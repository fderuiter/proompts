# Smart Task Prioritizer

**"Here's my to-do list: ‹PASTE›
Create a table with columns — Task, Urgency (1-5), Impact (1-5), Effort (1-5), Priority Score (Impact × Urgency ÷ Effort).
Sort by highest Score.
After the table, suggest the first three tasks I should do and explain why in two sentences each."**
