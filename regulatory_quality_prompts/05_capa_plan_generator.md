# CAPA Plan Generator

## Prompt

Act as a GxP audit consultant for our CRO. You have received a draft sponsor audit report listing five major findings (below). Generate a Corrective and Preventive Action (CAPA) plan that satisfies FDA 21 CFR 820.100 and ISO 13485:2016.

## Findings

1. Informed-consent forms at Site 17 lack a version date.
1. Temperature excursions for IMP not logged for 48 h.
1. Source-data-verification backlog > 30 days at three sites.
1. Unblinded vendor contracts missing from eTMF.
1. Training records incomplete for two CRAs.

## Deliverables

* Root-cause analysis for each finding (use “5 Whys”).
* SMART corrective and preventive actions with owners & deadlines.
* Effectiveness-check description.
* Present as a CAPA tracker table ready for Excel import.
* Finish with one sentence on how the plan prevents recurrence.
