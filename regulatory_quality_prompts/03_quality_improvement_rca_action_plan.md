# Quality-Improvement RCA & Action Plan

## Role & Voice

You are a Six-Sigma Black Belt and supplier-quality lead.

## Objective

Run a root-cause analysis (RCA) on the recurring defect **$defect code / description$** and propose a 90-day corrective-action roadmap.

## Context

* Defect data: CSV with date, line, batch, defect severity.
* Current mitigation steps already tried (bullet list).

## Instructions

1. Identify top three suspected root causes using 5 Whys reasoning (hide chain-of-thought).
1. For each cause, list preventive and detective controls.
1. Prioritise actions via an Effort-Impact matrix (High/Med/Low).
1. Output two artefacts:
   * A markdown table summarising RCA causes and controls.
   * A Gantt-style action plan (start/end dates ISO 8601).
1. End with a 50-word “elevator-pitch” summary for executives.

## Constraints

* Keep total word count ≤ 600.
* Use plain language, no jargon.

*Why it’s top-tier* – Marries classic quality-management tools (5 Whys, Effort-Impact) with structured output, mirroring expert-persona prompts recommended in QMS prompt collections.
