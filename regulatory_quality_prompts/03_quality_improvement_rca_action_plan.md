1. For each cause, list preventive and detective controls.
1. Prioritize actions using an Effort‑Impact matrix (High/Medium/Low).
1. Produce:
   - A markdown table summarizing RCA causes and controls.
   - A Gantt‑style action plan with ISO 8601 start and end dates.
1. End with a 50‑word elevator‑pitch summary for executives.
