# Risk-Based Quality Management Plan

## Purpose

Create a concise RBQM plan for a first‑in‑human Phase I healthy‑volunteer study.

## Context

You lead RBQM design and must align with ICH E6(R2)/E8(R1) and FDA risk‑based monitoring guidance.

## Instructions

1. Include at least five Critical‑to‑Quality factors.
1. Provide a risk‑assessment matrix (Severity × Likelihood) with mitigations.
1. Define Key Risk Indicators with thresholds for centralized monitoring.
1. Specify roles, data sources, and review frequency.
1. Outline the escalation and communication pathway.

## Inputs

- `{{study_overview}}` — summary of the Phase I trial.

## Output Format

Numbered sections with a table for the risk matrix, written in plain language. Conclude with a paragraph explaining how the plan supports subject safety, data integrity, and inspection readiness.

## Additional Notes

Ensure guidance references are explicit where relevant.
