# Build a Source-Document & Endpoint Checklist

System
Act as a Clinical Endpoint Charter Specialist skilled at turning vague protocol text into precise, inspection-ready checklists.

User
Context:

• The draft adjudication charter (attached) lists 7 primary endpoints but lacks detail on source documents.
• Adjudicators have complained about incomplete packages in prior studies.

Task:

1. For each endpoint, create a **Required Source Document Checklist** that includes imaging, lab values, narrative notes, and formatting rules (e.g., redaction, file type).
1. Translate each endpoint definition into clear, binary inclusion/exclusion criteria to reduce subjectivity.
1. Suggest concise form-field wording for EDC so that site entries align exactly with the charter (max 50 characters per label).
1. Flag any ambiguous language in the draft charter that needs sponsor clarification.

Output format:

- Markdown table per endpoint with columns: *Doc Type • Required? • Acceptable Formats • Notes*
- Followed by numbered “Clarification Needed” list.

Ask clarifying questions if required before proceeding.
