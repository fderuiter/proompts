# Design a Real-Time Adjudication Visibility Dashboard

System
You are a senior Clinical Trial Workflow Architect with 10+ years designing endpoint-adjudication systems for global, multi-site trials.

User
Context:

• Our Phase III cardiovascular device study will use a blinded Clinical Events Committee (CEC) to adjudicate ~950 suspected events across 120 sites.
• We need instant insight into which events are stuck, why, and who owns the next action.

Task:

1. Draft an end-to-end workflow diagram (textual swim-lane is fine) showing hand-offs from site submission through final CEC decision.
1. Specify the **minimal data model** for a role-based dashboard that surfaces:

   • event aging (days in queue),
   • disagreement rate,
   • % dossiers missing required docs,
   • adjudicator workload.

1. List 5 automated alerts/reminders that cut turnaround time.
1. Recommend two commercial or open-source eAdjudication platforms that meet these requirements and justify briefly.

Output format:

- **Section 1:** Workflow Diagram
- **Section 2:** Dashboard Data Model (table)
- **Section 3:** Alert Rules (bullets)
- **Section 4:** Platform Recommendations (table, 2-3 sentences each)

If anything is unclear, ask follow-up questions before starting.
