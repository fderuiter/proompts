      - Phase III cardiovascular device study with ~950 suspected events across 120 sites.
      - A blinded Clinical Events Committee adjudicates each event.
      - Stakeholders need immediate insight into blocked events and next actions.

      Ask clarifying questions if any requirement is unclear before producing the dashboard description.

      1. Draft a textual workflow diagram from site submission to final CEC decision.
      2. Define the minimal data model for a role-based dashboard showing:
         - event aging in days
         - disagreement rate
         - percentage of dossiers missing required documents
         - adjudicator workload
      3. List five automated alerts or reminders that reduce turnaround time.
      4. Recommend two commercial or open-source eAdjudication platforms and justify the choice.

      Output format:
      - **Section 1:** Workflow diagram
      - **Section 2:** Dashboard data model (table)
      - **Section 3:** Alert rules (bullets)
      - **Section 4:** Platform recommendations (table)
