Calculate the minimum total sample size to achieve at least 90\u00a0% power given assumed response rates and drop-out rate.\n1. Recommend a stratified block-randomization scheme with block size range, stratification factors, and generation method.\n1. Explain any sensitivity or re-estimation options.\n1. Provide R code using `pwr` or `power.prop.test` and `randomizeR` with inline comments.\n1. Summarize key references to statistical guidance.",
