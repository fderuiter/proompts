Background  
We are preparing the SAP for Study AB-123, a Phase IIb adaptive dose-ranging trial in NASH (five arms; N ≈ 250). Primary endpoint: change in ALT from baseline to Week 24.

Deliverable  
Write Sections 1–8 of the SAP template:  
1. Title page & administrative details  
2. Study objectives & hypotheses  
3. Study design overview (include schematic)  
4. Analysis populations & handling of protocol deviations  
5. Endpoints & estimands (ICH E9[R1])  
6. Statistical methods (models, covariance structure, interim rules)  
7. Missing-data strategy (MI with δ-adjustment sensitivity)  
8. Mock TLF shells (summary stats & forest-plot layout)

Formatting rules  
• Use numbered headings (H2 level).  
• Mock tables/figures: present as markdown tables with placeholder cells.  
• Keep each subsection ≤ 250 words.  
• Do not reveal internal reasoning steps.
