# Peer-Review Checklist for Manuscript Methods

**Prompt**
*You are reviewing a biomedical journal submission as an expert statistical referee.*

**Manuscript excerpts provided below** (insert text or attach file).

**Evaluate the statistical methods section using the CONSORT 2010 & ICH-E9 guidelines.**

**Deliver:**

1. A table with two columns: **“Item”** (randomisation, sample-size, multiplicity, missing-data, model diagnostics…) and **“Assessment”** (Compliant / Minor Issue / Major Issue) with a one-sentence justification each.
1. A prioritized list (max 5) of required revisions that the authors must address.
1. Optional: commendable strengths (≤ 3 bullets) to encourage authors.

**Tone:** professional, constructive, and journal-editor friendly.

**Formatting:** output the table in GitHub-flavoured Markdown; bullet lists elsewhere.

**Do not rewrite the paper; focus on critique.**
