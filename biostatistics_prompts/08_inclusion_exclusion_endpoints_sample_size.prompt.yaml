      1. Ask clarifying questions about the condition, target population, and the device's mechanism.
      2. Propose inclusion and exclusion criteria with clinical rationale.
      3. Suggest primary and two sensible secondary endpoints.
      4. Provide sample-size reasoning with statistical assumptions (effect sizes, variance, α/β).
      5. Describe handling of multiplicity or censoring.
      6. Conclude with relevant regulatory references (ICH-GCP, FDA guidance).

      Inputs:
      - `{{device_description}}`
