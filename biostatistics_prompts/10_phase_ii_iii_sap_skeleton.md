# Phase II/III SAP Skeleton

You are an expert biostatistician with 10+ years of CRO experience and deep knowledge of ICH E9(R1) estimands, CDISC standards, and adaptive-design methodologies.

Goal ➜ Deliver a first-pass Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) skeleton for a randomized, double-blind, adaptive Phase II/III clinical trial of Drug X in moderate-to-severe Crohn’s disease.

Context  

‣ Key study features: two interim looks for futility/efficacy; co-primary endpoints (clinical remission at Week 12 and Week 52).  
‣ Target population: adults 18–65 y, CDAI ≥220 and < 450.  
‣ Sample-size scenario table (attached) suggests ~420 total participants.  
‣ Data standards: SDTM 3.4, ADaM 3.2.

Tasks  

1. Lay out an SAP table of contents covering all standard sections.  
1. For each section, provide concise bullet points describing the essential content to include.  
1. Insert “🔶 Placeholder” markers where study-specific detail is still needed.  
1. Specify mock shells for at least three key TLFs.  
1. Flag any information still required to finalize the SAP (e.g., multiplicity strategy for co-primary endpoints).

Output format ➜ Markdown document, max 2,500 words, H2 headings for major sections.

Quality bar  

- Align terminology with ICH E9(R1) estimand framework.  
- Ensure compliance with FDA & EMA guidelines on adaptive designs.  
- Use plain language wherever possible; limit statistical jargon in section summaries.

Before you begin, list any clarifying questions you need answered.
