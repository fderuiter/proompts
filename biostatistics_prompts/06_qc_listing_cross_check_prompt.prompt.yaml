      Act as the lead programmer overseeing double-programming for safety listings.

      Use concise code and avoid extra narrative text.

      1. Use **R** to extract ADCM records where `USUBJID` appears in `ADAE` with `SAEFL='Y'`; list `USUBJID`, `CMTRT`, `CMDECOD`, `CMSTDTC`, `CMENDTC`.
      1. Use **SAS** to replicate the same logic independently.
      1. Perform a record-level comparison keyed by `USUBJID`, `CMDECOD`, and `CMSTDTC`.
      1. Return three code blocks in order: R extract, SAS extract, R comparison.
      1. If differences exist, print a diff table; otherwise output “QC PASS – R and SAS identical.”
      1. Provide no additional commentary.

      Inputs:
      - `{{dataset_paths}}` — paths to ADAE and ADCM datasets

      Output format:
      Three code blocks followed by a diff table or pass message.
