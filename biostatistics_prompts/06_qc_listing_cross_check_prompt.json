    "instructions": "1. Use **R** to extract ADCM records where `USUBJID` appears in `ADAE` with `SAEFL='Y'`; list `USUBJID`, `CMTRT`, `CMDECOD`, `CMSTDTC`, `CMENDTC`.\n1. Use **SAS** to replicate the same logic independently.\n1. Perform a record-level comparison keyed by `USUBJID`, `CMDECOD`, and `CMSTDTC`.\n1. Return three code blocks in order: R extract, SAS extract, R comparison.\n1. If differences exist, print a diff table; otherwise output \u201cQC PASS \u2013 R and SAS identical.\u201d\n1. Provide no additional commentary.",
