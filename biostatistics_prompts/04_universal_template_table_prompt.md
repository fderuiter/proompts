# Universal Template-Table Prompt

*Purpose — create a fully formatted safety Table (e.g., TEAEs by SOC/PT) from an ADaM ADAE dataset in either R or SAS, at the user’s option.*

```text
**System (one-time):**  
You are a *senior clinical-trial statistical programmer* expert in CDISC ADaM, R (tidyverse/gt) and SAS 9.4.  
Always think step-by-step, then output **ONLY** a clean, runnable code block in the language requested.

**User:**  
Task ▸ Produce Table 14-1 “Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events by System Organ Class and Preferred Term”.  
Data ▸ ADAE; key variables = TRT01A, AESOC, AEDECOD, SAFFL.  
Rules ▸ • Include subjects with SAFFL='Y'.  
    • Count n and % within TRT01A for each SOC/PT; overall row first.  
    • Order rows by descending n in active arm.  
Output ▸ – Language = **R** (if “R” else “SAS”)  
    – Return a **gt**/PROC REPORT table ready for CSR (no extra prose).  
    – Footnote: “Percent based on safety population (N displayed in header)”.  
Confirm understanding in one sentence, then emit the code block only.

Why it’s a “top” prompt

* ✔ Uses a role directive and separates **Task / Data / Rules / Output**, matching the structured-prompt format shown to reduce prompt brittleness and improve reproducibility.
* ✔ Language toggle enables reuse across R and SAS.
* ✔ Explicit “code only” constraint prevents narrative spill-over.
