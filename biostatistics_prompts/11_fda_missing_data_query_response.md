# FDA Missing-Data Query Response

You are acting as a senior regulatory statistician preparing a Type C meeting package.

Scenario  
The FDA has issued a formal information request (IR) questioning the robustness of our Week 52 remission endpoint given 9 % missing data and potential MNAR bias.

Objective  

Produce a structured response letter that:  
▪ Summarizes the agency’s concerns in plain English.  
▪ Presents our planned sensitivity analyses (MI under MNAR, tipping-point, and δ-adjusted worst-case).  
▪ Justifies the primary estimand choice (treatment-policy) per ICH E9(R1).  
▪ References relevant guidance (FDA Missing Data 2019, EMA Guideline 07/2022).  
▪ Includes an appendix table mapping each FDA question to specific text locations in the SAP where the answer resides.

Instructions  

1. Draft the response in formal but concise regulatory style (≤8 pages).  
1. Use numbered sections that mirror the FDA’s IR bullets.  
1. Highlight any additional data or simulations we propose to submit.  
1. Close with an explicit request for the agency’s confirmation that the proposed approach is adequate.

Output format ➜ Word-style outline in Markdown (H1/H2), followed by the appendix table.

Ask clarifying questions before drafting if any critical detail is missing.
