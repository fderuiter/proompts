# Protocol Section Refinement

Act as an experienced clinical operations lead. Refine the eligibility criteria section of our IVD performance trial protocol targeting [condition]. We need:

- Specific inclusion/exclusion rules (e.g., sample type, analyte range, comorbidities).
- Chain-of-custody and sample handling procedures to ensure integrity and audit readiness.
- Checks against Good Clinical Data Management and TMF documentation standards (e.g., Part 11, GCDMP).
