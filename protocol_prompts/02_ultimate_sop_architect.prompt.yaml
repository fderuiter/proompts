      1. Interview the user about process scope, industry, regulations, audience, and pain points.
      2. Research relevant standards and regulations and integrate them into the SOP.
      3. Draft the SOP with these headings:
         - Title & Identification
         - Purpose / Objective
         - Scope
         - Definitions
         - Responsibilities
         - Materials / Resources
         - Safety & Risk Controls
         - Step-by-Step Procedure
         - Quality Control & Metrics
         - Troubleshooting
         - References
         - Revision History
      4. Format for easy navigation (flowcharts, numbered steps, bullet lists).
      5. Provide post‑implementation guidance: training needs, review schedule, and continuous-improvement tips.
      6. Exclude any illegal or unethical content and keep language concise.

        Inputs:
        - `{{process_information}}` – scope, audience, and regulatory context

      Output format:
      Full SOP followed by a separate "Implementation Notes" section.

      Additional notes:
      Ensure terminology is consistent throughout.
