# Prompt Engineering Utilities

This directory contains **Meta-Prompts**, agent scripts, and specialized utilities for maintaining, refining, and standardizing the prompt library.

> [!NOTE]
> Unlike the core meta-prompts located in `prompts/meta/` (which are production-ready YAML files), this folder serves as a "workshop" for experimental tools, maintenance scripts, and long-form agent instructions.

## Tool Descriptions

### Architecture Review Pipeline
**File:** [`01_architecture_review_pipeline.md`](./01_architecture_review_pipeline.md)

A comprehensive 7-stage pipeline designed to analyze a codebase's architecture. It includes prompts for:
1. High-Level Overview
2. Component & Dependency Mapping
3. Quality & Maintainability Assessment
4. Performance, Scalability & Security Review
5. Documentation Generation
6. Improvement Roadmap
7. Unified Architecture Review (Master Prompt)

### Prompt Optimizer
**File:** [`L5_prompt_optimizer.prompt.yaml`](./L5_prompt_optimizer.prompt.yaml)

A recursive meta-prompt that iteratively improves a given instruction set. It drafts a version, critiques it, rewrites it, and repeats the process until a quality score is met.

### Refactor & Re-index Agent
**File:** [`L5_refactor-reindex-prompts.md`](./L5_refactor-reindex-prompts.md)

An autonomous agent script ("Mission") for splitting large prompts into smaller parts and updating the documentation index. It defines operational constraints, success criteria, and a step-by-step plan for an AI agent to execute.

### Standardize Prompt Files
**File:** [`L5_standardize-prompt-files.md`](./L5_standardize-prompt-files.md)

A guide and agent persona for migrating prompt files to a standard YAML schema. It enforces consistent front-matter, header structures, and formatting conventions across the repository.

### Prompt Sanitiser
**File:** [`L5_prompt_sanitiser.md`](./L5_prompt_sanitiser.md)

A system prompt that acts as a filter to clean "raw" prompts. It removes source artifacts (footnotes, citations) and reformats the text into a clean, imperative style suitable for the repository.

## Usage Guide

Most tools in this directory are designed to be used with an LLM (like ChatGPT or Claude) to perform meta-tasks on the repository itself.

### Using Markdown Tools (`.md`)
1. Open the file (e.g., `L5_prompt_sanitiser.md`).
2. Copy the entire content.
3. Paste it into your LLM chat interface as the "System" or first "User" message.
4. Provide the target content (e.g., the raw prompt you want to sanitize) as the next message.

### Using YAML Prompts (`.prompt.yaml`)
These files follow the repository's standard schema and can be executed using the workflow engine (if supported) or used as templates.

```bash
# Example: Running the Prompt Optimizer (hypothetical usage if supported by run_workflow.py)
python3 tools/scripts/run_workflow.py tools/prompt_tools/L5_prompt_optimizer.prompt.yaml -i task="Write a Python script to scrape a website"
```

## Contribution

### Naming Conventions

- **`L5_`**: Denotes "Level 5" or highly autonomous/meta-level tools. These are often complex instructions for agents to act on the repository itself.
- **`01_`**: Standard sequential numbering for pipelines or series.

### Adding a New Tool
1. Create a clear, descriptive filename.
2. If it's a prompt, use `.prompt.yaml`.
3. If it's a guide or agent script, use `.md`.
4. Update this `README.md` with a description.
