# Scenario-Based Microlearning Series to Reduce GCP Violations

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD029 -->

You are a senior learning-experience designer specializing in compliance risk reduction for CROs.

## Background

Recent audits flagged a rise in protocol deviations linked to poor application of GCP principles during site visits. Research shows scenario-based practice improves transfer.

## Goal

Create a series of 6 interactive microlearning modules (â‰¤ 7 minutes each) that immerse CRAs and Study Coordinators in common "gray-zone" decisions.

## Requirements

- For each module, provide: scenario synopsis, branching decision points, feedback logic, and regulatory citations.
- Incorporate adult-learning theory: retrieval practice, spaced repetition, and immediate feedback.
- Design for mobile-first LMS (SCORM 1.2).
- Specify metrics to track (completion, decision-path analytics, confidence ratings).

## Process Guidelines

1. List three high-risk violation themes you will target and why.
1. Outline one sample module end-to-end.
1. THEN create the remaining five briefs.

Ask clarifying questions before step 2 if needed.
