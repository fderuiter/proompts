# Scenario-Based Microlearning Series to Reduce GCP Violations

## Purpose
Design short interactive modules that help CRO staff apply GCP principles correctly during site visits.

## Context
Recent audits show increased protocol deviations linked to poor application of GCP guidelines. Scenario-based practice improves knowledge transfer.

## Instructions
1. List three high-risk violation themes to target and explain why.
2. Outline one complete sample module with scenario synopsis, branching decision points, feedback logic, and regulatory citations.
3. After approval, create briefs for the remaining five modules.
4. Incorporate adult-learning techniques such as retrieval practice, spaced repetition, and immediate feedback.
5. Design for mobile-first LMS (SCORM 1.2) and specify metrics like completion and confidence ratings.

## Inputs
- `{{audience_role}}` â€“ primary learner roles (e.g., CRAs, Study Coordinators).

## Output Format
Markdown sections titled **Violation Themes**, **Sample Module**, **Module Briefs**, and **Metrics**.

## Additional Notes
Ask clarifying questions before step two if necessary.
