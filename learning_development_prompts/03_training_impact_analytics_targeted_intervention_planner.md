- Employee metadata such as role, tenure, and geography.

## Instructions
1. Provide a data-prep checklist covering cleansing and feature engineering.
2. Propose two predictive model options and explain their pros and cons.
3. Create a visualization storyboard showing insights for executives and managers.
4. Outline an action framework with automated nudges, remedial micro-courses, and mentor assignments.
5. Emphasize privacy (GDPR) and small-sample precautions.
6. Reference at least one open-source Python library for each step.
7. Think through potential confounders before proposing models.

## Inputs
- `{{analysis_goal}}` â€“ specific compliance or performance metric to improve.

## Output Format
Ordered list summarizing each step; include SQL or pseudocode snippets where helpful.

## Additional Notes
