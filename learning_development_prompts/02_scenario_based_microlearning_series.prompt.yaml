    content: 'Recent audits show increased protocol deviations linked to poor application
      of GCP guidelines. Scenario-based practice improves knowledge transfer.


      1. List three high-risk violation themes to target and explain why.

      2. Outline one complete sample module with scenario synopsis, branching decision
      points, feedback logic, and regulatory citations.

      3. After approval, create briefs for the remaining five modules.

      4. Incorporate adult-learning techniques such as retrieval practice, spaced
      repetition, and immediate feedback.

      5. Design for mobile-first LMS (SCORM 1.2) and specify metrics like completion
      and confidence ratings.


      Ask clarifying questions before step two if necessary.'
