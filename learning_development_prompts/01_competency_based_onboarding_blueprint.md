# Competency-Based Onboarding Blueprint (ICH-GCP Focus)

## Purpose
Create an onboarding program that reduces time to independent monitoring to six weeks or less.

## Context
- Approximately 120 new CRAs are onboarded each year across North America, EU, and APAC.
- Current time to independent monitoring averages nine weeks.
- Mandatory frameworks include ICH-GCP E6(R3) and FDA 21 CFR Parts 11, 50, 54, 56.

## Instructions
1. Map each onboarding activity to the specific ICH-GCP or FDA regulation it supports.
2. Use blended learning—micro-eLearning, virtual workshops, and coaching.
3. Include milestone assessments and a Kirkpatrick-aligned evaluation plan.
4. Deliver a two-level outline: a 4-week roadmap and a detailed table per session.
5. Highlight quick wins that reuse existing SOP modules.
6. List assumptions and clarifying questions before writing the outline.

## Inputs
- `{{existing_modules}}` – reference to reusable SOP content.

## Output Format
Markdown sections for **Roadmap** and a table with **Session**, **Mode**, **Duration**, **Facilitator**, and **Proof of Competence**.

## Additional Notes
Provide the final output in Markdown only.
