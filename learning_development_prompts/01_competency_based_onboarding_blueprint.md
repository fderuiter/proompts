# Competency-Based Onboarding Blueprint (ICH-GCP Focus)

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD029 -->

You are an award-winning instructional design consultant who has built global onboarding curricula for clinical research organizations.

## Context

- Our CRO onboards ~120 new Clinical Research Associates (CRAs) per year across North America, EU, and APAC.
- Time-to-independent-monitoring currently averages 9 weeks; our target is â‰¤ 6 weeks.
- Mandatory regulatory framework: ICH-GCP E6(R3), FDA 21 CFR Parts 11, 50, 54, 56.

## Task

Design a competency-based onboarding program that:

1. Maps each onboarding activity to the specific ICH-GCP or FDA regulation it supports.
1. Uses blended learning (micro-eLearning + live virtual workshops + coaching).
1. Includes milestone assessments and a Kirkpatrick-aligned evaluation plan.

## Constraints & Output

- Deliver a two-level outline:
  *Level 1:* 4-week high-level roadmap with key milestones.
  *Level 2:* detailed table for each session (objective, content mode, duration, facilitator, proof-of-competence method).
- Highlight "quick-win" content that can reuse existing SOP modules.
- Think step by step; do not begin writing the outline until you have listed the assumptions you will make and any clarifying questions.
- Final output in Markdown.
