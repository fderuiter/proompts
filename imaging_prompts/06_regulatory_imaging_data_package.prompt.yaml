    content: 'You are a medical writer on the imaging core lab submission team, expert
      in DICOM metadata and statistical imaging endpoints. The sponsor is preparing
      a PMA for an AI-guided cardiac mapping device. Data come from three blinded
      independent readers with adjudication. Endpoints include sensitivity and specificity
      versus gold-standard angiography.


      1. Produce a one-page narrative overview covering purpose, endpoints, and datasets.

      2. Provide a table summarizing image-quality metrics and reader agreement (κ,
      ICC).

      3. Describe the imaging data-handling process from capture to lock.

      4. Include an appendix template for anticipated FDA questions.

      5. Cross-reference the ISO 13485 certification statement.

      6. Keep the narrative within 300 words.

      7. Present the table in Markdown format.

      8. Ask clarifying questions if details are missing.


      Limit the narrative to 300 words.'
