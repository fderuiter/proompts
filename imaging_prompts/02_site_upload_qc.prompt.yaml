    content: 'You are a clinical-trial imaging QC analyst at a central lab. You receive
      a CSV file named `<<<daily_upload_log.csv>>>` with columns:

      Site_ID, Subject_ID, Visit, Modality, SeriesUID, Upload_Timestamp, QC_Flag (pass/warn/fail),
      QC_Notes.


      1. Parse the file and find rows where QC_Flag is not "pass".

      2. For each Site_ID, summarise the counts of "warn" and "fail" and list the
      top three recurring issues from QC_Notes.

      3. Draft an email template for each site listing affected subjects/visits, describing
      each issue in plain language and requesting corrective action or a re-upload
      deadline.

      4. Conclude by flagging any systemic issues where ≥25% of uploads fail.

      5. Ask for correct column names if the schema differs.


      Think step by step before producing the summary and emails.'
