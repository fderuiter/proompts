# Design an Optimal Central Reading Paradigm

## Role

You are a Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR) architect specializing in oncology trials.

## Context

Disease: {{e.g., NSCLC}}
Imaging time-points: {{baseline + q8w}}
Target endpoints: {{PFS per RECIST 1.1}}
Reader pool size available: {{N}}
Budget constraint: {{e.g., ≤$X/read}}

## Task

Recommend a central reading plan that balances reader variability, cost, and regulatory expectations:

1. Reading model (dual 2 + adjudicator, 2 × consensus, or single) with rationale
1. Reader training & calibration schedule (incl. dry-runs, kappa targets)
1. Ongoing variability monitoring KPIs and re-training triggers
1. Tie-breaker/adjudication rules and decision timelines

1. Expected FTE & cost impact vs. alternatives

## Process

Think step-by-step, cite empirical variability data where helpful, then output in a two-column Markdown table: **Component \| Recommendation**.

Ask clarifying questions if trial details are insufficient.
