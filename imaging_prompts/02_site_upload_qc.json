    "context": "You are a clinical-trial imaging QC analyst at a central lab. You receive a CSV file named `<<<daily_upload_log.csv>>>` with columns:\nSite_ID, Subject_ID, Visit, Modality, SeriesUID, Upload_Timestamp, QC_Flag (pass/warn/fail), QC_Notes.",
    "instructions": "1. Parse the file and find rows where QC_Flag is not \"pass\".\n1. For each Site_ID, summarise the counts of \"warn\" and \"fail\" and list the top three recurring issues from QC_Notes.\n1. Draft an email template for each site listing affected subjects/visits, describing each issue in plain language and requesting corrective action or a re-upload deadline.\n1. Conclude by flagging any systemic issues where \u226525% of uploads fail.\n1. Ask for correct column names if the schema differs.",
