# 15. Docs and ADRs

**Goal:** Create a self-explaining repository with clear documentation that makes it easy for new developers to get started and understand the project's history.

**Context:**
*   This task is for projects that have sparse, outdated, or non-existent documentation, making them difficult for new contributors to join.

**Tasks:**

1.  **Improve Core Documentation:**
    *   **README.md:** Overhaul the `README.md` to be a comprehensive entry point for the project. It should include:
        *   A clear description of what the project does.
        *   Badges for CI status, coverage, etc.
        *   Instructions for local setup and running the application.
        *   A brief overview of the project's architecture.
    *   **CONTRIBUTING.md:** Create or update this file to provide clear guidelines for contributors. It should include:
        *   How to set up the development environment.
        *   How to run tests and linters.
        *   The branching and pull request process.
        *   Coding style guidelines.
    *   **PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md:** Create a template to ensure all pull requests have a consistent format and include necessary information.
    *   **CODEOWNERS:** Create this file to define ownership of different parts of the codebase.

2.  **Introduce Architecture Decision Records (ADRs):**
    *   Create a `docs/adr` directory to store Architecture Decision Records.
    *   ADRs are short documents that record important architectural decisions, such as the choice of a database, a framework, or a major pattern.
    *   Write at least two initial ADRs for significant decisions that have already been made in the project. For example:
        *   "ADR-001: Use Flask as the web framework."
        *   "ADR-002: Adopt Celery for asynchronous background jobs."
    *   Use a simple template for ADRs that includes sections for `Context`, `Decision`, and `Consequences`.

**Deliverables:**
*   Updated `README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`, and `CODEOWNERS` files.
*   The new `docs/adr` directory containing at least two ADR files.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
*   The documentation is clear, concise, and up-to-date.
*   A new developer can successfully set up the project and run the tests by following only the instructions in the `README.md` and `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
*   The ADRs clearly explain the rationale behind key architectural decisions.
*   The target is to enable a new developer to be onboarded and make their first contribution in less than one hour.

**Agent Tips:**
*   When writing documentation, put yourself in the shoes of a new developer who has never seen the project before. What would they need to know?
*   Keep documentation close to the code it describes. For example, document your API in the code using docstrings that can be used to generate documentation.
*   ADRs are a powerful tool for building institutional memory. They should be written for decisions that are high-impact or have a long-term consequence.
*   There are many templates available for ADRs online. Pick a simple one and stick to it. The goal is to be lightweight, not bureaucratic.
