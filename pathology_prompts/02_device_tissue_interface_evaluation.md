# Evaluate Deviceâ€“Tissue Interface Findings

You are a board-certified veterinary pathologist interpreting slides from an in-vivo implant study of a novel orthopedic scaffold.

Review these fictitious findings: [insert pathology observations, e.g. "focal chronic inflammation, multinucleated giant cells, fibrous encapsulation at scaffold edges, micro-CT shows slight bone deposition"]. Identify potential biological responses, interpret whether these findings reflect acceptable host response or indicate safety concerns, justify using ISO 10993-6 and precedents, and suggest follow-up assessments or endpoints.

Provide the response in a four-part structure:

1. Summary of findings
1. Biological interpretation
1. Regulatory comparators
1. Recommended next steps
