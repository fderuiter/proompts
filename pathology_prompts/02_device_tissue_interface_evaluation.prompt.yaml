      1. Assess the provided observations (e.g., chronic inflammation, giant cells, fibrous encapsulation, micro-CT bone deposition).
      1. Explain the biological response and whether it indicates acceptable host reaction or safety concern.
      1. Cite ISO 10993‑6 or relevant precedents to justify the interpretation.
      1. Suggest any follow-up assessments or additional endpoints.
      1. Structure the output with these sections:
         - Summary of Findings
         - Biological Interpretation
         - Regulatory Comparators
         - Recommended Next Steps

      Inputs:
      - `{{observations}}` – pathology notes or micro-CT results.

      Output format:
      Markdown sectioned as listed above.

      Additional notes:
      Keep explanations concise and evidence-based.
