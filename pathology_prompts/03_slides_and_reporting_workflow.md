# Prepare Pathology Slides & Reporting Plan

You are designing a pathology workflow for a preclinical study of a cardiovascular stent under GLP. Study objectives include evaluating thrombogenicity, endothelialization, and neointimal formation.

List the required histology slide types, stains, sampling locations, and imaging needs (e.g. SEM, plastic embedding). Then outline a draft slide transfer and peer-review schedule with key milestones (e.g. gross review → processing → 1st pathologist review → peer review → sign-off).

Organize the answer as two tables:

- Table 1: Slides, Stains & Imaging
- Table 2: Pathology Review Workflow with timelines in days post-necropsy
