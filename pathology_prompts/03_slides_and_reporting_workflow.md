# Prepare Pathology Slides and Reporting Plan

## Purpose

Plan slide preparation and review activities for a GLP cardiovascular stent study.

## Context

You are designing a pathology workflow that assesses thrombogenicity, endothelialization, and neointimal formation.

## Instructions

1. List histology slide types, stains, sampling locations, and imaging needs (e.g., SEM, plastic embedding).
1. Outline a slide transfer and peer-review schedule with key milestones such as gross review, processing, first pathologist review, peer review, and sign-off.
1. Present the information in two tables:
   - **Slides, Stains & Imaging**
   - **Pathology Review Workflow** with timelines in days post‑necropsy.

## Inputs

- `{{study_objectives}}` – brief description of study goals.

## Output Format

Two Markdown tables as described above.

## Additional Notes

Keep the schedule concise and GLP compliant.
