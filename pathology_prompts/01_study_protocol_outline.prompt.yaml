      1. Provide risk-based selection of species, sample sizes, and timepoints.
      1. Describe necropsy procedures, macro- and histopathology endpoints.
      1. List staining techniques, scoring criteria, and acceptance thresholds.
      1. Explain imaging modalities such as micro-CT or SEM.
      1. Include QA steps to maintain GLP compliance.
      1. Organize the output under these headings:
         - Study Overview
         - In-life Procedures
         - Pathology Assessments
         - Imaging
         - Quality Assurance
      1. Use bullet points under each section.

      Inputs:
      - `{{study_details}}` â€“ summary of the device and objectives.

      Output format:
      Markdown outline using the sections above.

      Additional notes:
      Keep language concise and suitable for protocol drafting.
