# Design a Robust Preclinical Pathology Study Protocol

You are a senior preclinical pathologist with deep expertise in medical device evaluation. The study is GLP-compliant and aligns with FDA 21 CFR 58 and ISO 10993-6.

Draft a detailed study protocol outline that includes:

- Risk-based selection of species, sample sizes, and timepoints;
- Necropsy procedures, macroscopic and histopathology endpoints;
- Staining techniques, scoring criteria, and acceptance thresholds;
- Imaging modalities (micro-CT, SEM) rationale;
- QA steps to ensure GLP compliance.

Respond with a structured outline:

1. Study Overview
1. In-life Procedures
1. Pathology Assessments
1. Imaging
1. Quality Assurance

Use bullet points under each section.
