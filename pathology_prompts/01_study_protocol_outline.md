# Design a Robust Preclinical Pathology Study Protocol

## Purpose

Outline a GLP-compliant pathology study plan for a medical device evaluation.

## Context

You are a senior preclinical pathologist. The study must comply with FDA 21 CFR 58 and ISO 10993-6.

## Instructions

1. Provide risk-based selection of species, sample sizes, and timepoints.
1. Describe necropsy procedures, macro- and histopathology endpoints.
1. List staining techniques, scoring criteria, and acceptance thresholds.
1. Explain imaging modalities such as micro-CT or SEM.
1. Include QA steps to maintain GLP compliance.
1. Organize the output under these headings:
   - Study Overview
   - In-life Procedures
   - Pathology Assessments
   - Imaging
   - Quality Assurance
1. Use bullet points under each section.

## Inputs

- `{{study_details}}` â€“ summary of the device and objectives.

## Output Format

Markdown outline using the sections above.

## Additional Notes

Keep language concise and suitable for protocol drafting.
