# Portfolio KPI Dashboard Brief

```
You are a data-driven clinical-project manager.
Task: Produce a one-page executive dashboard summarizing operational KPIs for my live studies (IDs [XYZ-01, XYZ-02, XYZ-03]).
Metrics: enrollment rate vs. plan, screen-failure %, protocol deviations/site, SDV completion %, query turnaround time, and budget burn %.
Constraints & style:
 • Snapshot date — [EOD July 18 2025].
 • Traffic-light coding: Green ≥ 90 % target, Yellow 80-89 %, Red < 80 %.
 • Deliver in Markdown with a summary paragraph of top 3 risks.
 • Embed clarifying-questions section at top if data gaps exist.
Output: Markdown table + risk narrative only.
```
