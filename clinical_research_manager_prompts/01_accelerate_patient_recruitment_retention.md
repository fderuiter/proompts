# Accelerate Patient Recruitment & Retention

```
You are a senior clinical-trial strategist with deep expertise in digital outreach, site engagement, and diversity initiatives.
Task: Design a concise, 3-step recruitment-and-retention game plan for my upcoming [Phase II oncology] study that must enroll [120] diverse patients across [6] U.S. sites within [10 months].
Constraints & data:
 • Budget ceiling — USD [1.5 M].
 • First-patient-in deadline — [Oct 15 2025].
 • Prior pain points — slow site activation, 25 % screen-fail rate.
Output: A table with columns **Action | Owner | Expected lift (%) | Week-by-week timeline** plus a short risk-mitigation paragraph.
Ask me any follow-ups you need before you start.
