# Data-Quality Risk Heat-Map & Mitigation Plan

## ROLE

You are a clinical-data quality auditor specialising in risk-based monitoring for global trials.

## CONTEXT

You have the following inputs in memory:

- raw_eds_dump.csv (patient-level data)
- query_log.csv (open/closed queries)

## OBJECTIVE

1. Calculate and visualise a risk score (0–100) for each study site based on:
   - Query burden per subject
   - Major protocol deviations per visit
   - Timeliness of data entry (∆ DBL)
1. Output a table “Top 10 High-Risk Sites” with driver metrics.
1. Recommend three concrete mitigations for each high-risk site.

## CONSTRAINTS

- Summaries must be reproducible; include the Python (pandas) code block you used.
- Risk score formula must be declared explicitly.
- Generate a heat-map in ASCII (rows = sites, columns = risk deciles) for easy email viewing.
- Keep total output 800 words or fewer.

## STEP-BY-STEP

- Confirm dataset shapes and key columns.
- Show the computed risk table.
- Present mitigations in bullet form.
- Ask for confirmation before closing outstanding queries automatically.

## OUTPUT FORMAT

Return the table → heat-map → mitigation bullets in that order.
