      Clarify team responsibilities using a RACI matrix.
  - role: user
    content: |-
      1. Build a markdown table with columns Task, R, A, C, I for up to six tasks.
      2. After the table, add a 35-word reflection highlighting any overload and suggest one reassignment.

      Inputs:
      - `{{project_phase}}`: project phase description.
      - `{{tasks}}`: list of tasks with assigned initials.

      Output format:
      Markdown table followed by the reflection paragraph.

      Additional notes:
      Keep the response under 130 words and avoid jargon.
