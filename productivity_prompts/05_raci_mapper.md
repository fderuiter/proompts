# RACI Mapper

Objective: clarify roles for **[PROJECT PHASE]**.
Output a markdown table—Task | R | A | C | I—covering up to six key tasks; use team member initials.
After the table, add a 35-word reflection highlighting any overload (multiple Rs or As on one person) and propose one reassignment.
Limit to 130 words, no jargon.
