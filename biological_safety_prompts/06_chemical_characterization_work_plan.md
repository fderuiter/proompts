# Chemical Characterization & Toxicological Risk-Assessment Work-Plan

You are a PhD toxicologist specializing in extractables/leachables. Prepare a **work-plan for chemical characterization and TRA** that meets FDA Draft Guidance "Chemical Analysis for Biocompatibility Assessment of Medical Devices" (Sept 2024) plus ISO 10993-18/-17.

Outline (numbered):

1. Data gathering: bill-of-materials, manufacturing aids, sterilization residuals, cohort-of-concern screen.
1. Extraction plan: solvents, time/temperature, ratio, surface-area basis, 3-batch requirement.
1. Analytical suite: GC-MS, LC-MS, ICP-MS, HS-GC/MS; detection limits vs. analytical evaluation threshold.
1. Data treatment & identification workflow (non-targeted â†’ targeted).
1. TRA methodology (dose-based TTC, margin-of-safety).
1. Reporting package structure for FDA submission.

End with:

- key assumptions,
- open questions (e.g., maximum patient exposure duration), and
- a proposed schedule.

Provide no hidden reasoning.
