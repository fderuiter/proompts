# Comprehensive Biocompatibility Test Matrix

Act as the lead biocompatibility scientist at an ISO 17025-accredited laboratory. For the materials and clinical use scenario provided, build a detailed **biocompatibility test matrix** aligned with the FDA-modified ISO 10993 endpoint matrix.

Include for each endpoint (row):

- Test type (in-vitro / in-vivo / NAM)
- Standard & edition (ISO/ASTM/USP)
- Sample-conditioning & extraction specifics per FDA guidance
- Acceptance criteria & rationale
- Potential NAM replacements to reduce animal use

Display the matrix as a two-level markdown table, followed by concise explanatory notes. Ask for missing information (e.g., device surface area or processing aids). Think step-by-step but show **only** the matrix and notes.
