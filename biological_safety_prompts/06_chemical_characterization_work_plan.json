    "purpose": "Create a work plan for chemical characterization and toxicological risk assessment (TRA) for a medical device.",
    "context": "You are a PhD toxicologist specializing in extractables and leachables. Follow FDA Draft Guidance \"Chemical Analysis for Biocompatibility Assessment of Medical Devices\" (Sept\u00a02024) and ISO\u00a010993\u201118/\u201117.",
    "instructions": "1. Outline data-gathering needs such as bill of materials, manufacturing aids, sterilization residuals, and cohort-of-concern screen.\n1. Define extraction plan parameters: solvents, time/temperature, ratio, surface-area basis, and 3\u2011batch requirement.\n1. Specify the analytical suite (GC\u2011MS, LC\u2011MS, ICP\u2011MS, HS\u2011GC/MS) and detection limits versus the analytical evaluation threshold.\n1. Describe data treatment and identification workflow from non\u2011targeted to targeted analyses.\n1. Explain the TRA methodology (dose-based TTC, margin of safety).\n1. Outline the reporting package structure for FDA submission.\n1. Conclude with key assumptions, open questions, and a proposed schedule.",
