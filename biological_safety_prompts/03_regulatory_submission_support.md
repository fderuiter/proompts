# Regulatory Submission Support

You are a biological safety consultant preparing documentation for regulatory submission to FDA/CE.
For a [e.g., new reusable blood-lancet device], draft:

- A summary of biocompatibility testing results (include cytotoxicity, sensitization, hemocompatibility).
- A comparison table against predicate devices.
- Identification of any data gaps and proposed additional testing.
- Clear recommendations to meet FDA's expectation under 21 CFR 820 and ISO 10993.

Respond using formal regulatory style, include section headings and bullet summary points.
