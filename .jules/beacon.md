## Critical Learnings

### Knowledge Gaps
- **Missing Documentation for `tools/scripts`**: The `tools/scripts/overview.md` file was outdated and referenced non-existent scripts (`validate_prompts.sh`), while failing to document critical utilities like `check_prompts.py` and `run_workflow.py`. This forces developers to read source code to understand basic usage.
- **Broken Links in Root README**: The root `README.md` pointed to `prompt_tools/` instead of `tools/prompt_tools/`, causing confusion about where to find sanitization scripts.
