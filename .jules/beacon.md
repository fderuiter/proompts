## Critical Learnings

### Knowledge Gaps
- **(Resolved) Missing Documentation for `tools/scripts`**: The `tools/scripts/overview.md` file was outdated and referenced non-existent scripts. Fixed by renaming to `README.md` and documenting all scripts including `fix_markdown_issues.py` and `standardize_c_prompts.py`.
- **Broken Links in Root README**: The root `README.md` pointed to `prompt_tools/` instead of `tools/prompt_tools/`, causing confusion about where to find sanitization scripts.
