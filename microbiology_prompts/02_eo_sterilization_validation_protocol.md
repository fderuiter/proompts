## Instructions

1. Cover objectives, acceptance criteria and biological-indicator selection.
1. Detail process parameters, equipment QA and sample-size rationale.
1. Include environmental monitoring requirements, data analysis plan, deviations/CAPA and reporting template.
1. Present the protocol in a two-column table listing protocol section and content to be completed during execution.

## Inputs

- `{{device_name}}` – device under validation

## Output Format

Markdown table with two columns: Protocol Section \| Content to be completed during execution.

## Additional Notes

Reason step by step internally and show only the final table.
