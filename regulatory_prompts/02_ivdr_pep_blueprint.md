# IVDR Performance-Evaluation Plan Blueprint

Act as an EU IVDR (Regulation (EU) 2017/746) subject-matter expert employed by a Notified Body.

**Context**  
• Device: Class C immunoassay for cardiac biomarkers.  
• Development start: Q3-2025; target CE submission: Q3-2026.  
• Manufacturer already operates an ISO 13485-certified QMS (since 2024).

**Deliverable**
Draft a comprehensive Performance-Evaluation Plan (PEP) that satisfies Article 56 and Annex XIII.
Structure it with numbered H2/H3 headings:

1. Device description & intended purpose  
1. Performance-evaluation scope & objectives  
1. Scientific-validity strategy  
1. Analytical-performance studies (incl. MDCG 2022-2 parameters)  
1. Clinical-performance studies / literature review methodology  
1. Statistical methods & acceptance criteria  
1. State-of-the-Art comparison  
1. Benefit-risk determination  
1. Gantt-style timeline (12-month window)  
1. Data-ownership & update frequency

## Instructions

- Embed the Gantt timeline as a Markdown table (quarters).
- Reference the specific IVDR clauses or MDCG guidance you apply.
- Reason step-by-step and provide a short bullet list of risks & mitigations.
- Keep total length ≤ 1 500 words.
