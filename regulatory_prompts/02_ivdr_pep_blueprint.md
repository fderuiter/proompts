## Instructions

1. Structure the plan with numbered H2/H3 headings:
   - Device description and intended purpose.
   - Performance‑evaluation scope and objectives.
   - Scientific‑validity strategy.
   - Analytical‑performance studies (including MDCG 2022‑2 parameters).
   - Clinical‑performance studies or literature‑review methodology.
   - Statistical methods and acceptance criteria.
   - State‑of‑the‑art comparison.
   - Benefit‑risk determination.
   - Gantt‑style timeline (12‑month window).
   - Data ownership and update frequency.
1. Embed the Gantt timeline as a Markdown table (quarters).
1. Cite specific IVDR clauses or MDCG guidance used.
1. Provide a short bullet list of risks and mitigations.
1. Keep total length ≤1 500 words.

## Inputs

- `{{device_details}}` — any additional device information.

## Output Format
