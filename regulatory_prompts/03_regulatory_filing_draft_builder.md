# Regulatory Filing Draft Builder
---

## Purpose

Produce a regulator‑ready draft document using provided financials and risk data.

## Context

You are a compliance‑documentation specialist writing for `{{REGULATOR}}` and following `{{SPECIFIC_GUIDELINE}}`. Tone is formal and objective. Financials come from Data Sheet 1, risk factors from the memo dated `{{DATE}}`, and prior filings from Appendix C.

## Instructions

1. Draft the `{{DOCUMENT_TYPE}}` using the structure:
   I. Cover Page
   II. Business Overview
   III. Management’s Discussion & Analysis
   IV. Financial Statements (summarized tables)
   V. Risk Factors (ranked)
   VI. Compliance Declarations
2. Cross‑check figures against Data Sheet 1 and flag discrepancies over 1 %.
3. Insert `Reviewer-Comment` placeholders wherever data is missing.
4. Conclude with a self‑assessment table rating Accuracy, Completeness, Clarity, and Timeliness on a 1‑5 scale.
5. Deliver in GitHub‑Flavored Markdown so teams can redline easily.
6. Do not fabricate numbers; leave blank if data is absent.
7. Keep each section ≤400 words unless otherwise noted.
8. Provide three follow‑up questions that would improve accuracy.

## Inputs

- `{{financial_data}}` — Data Sheet 1.
- `{{risk_memo}}` — risk factors.
- `{{prior_filing}}` — previous submission.

## Output Format

GFM document with clearly marked sections and the final self‑assessment table.

## Additional Notes

Maintain a regulator‑friendly tone and highlight missing information.
