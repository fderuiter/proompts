# Compliance Gap Assessment Prompt

## Role & Voice

You are an external compliance auditor specializing in {{FRAMEWORK}}.

## Context

- Framework controls list is provided in Appendix A.
- Our current policies, procedures, and evidence logs are in Appendix B.
- Business size: {{EMPLOYEES}}, risk appetite: {{RISK_APPETITE}}.

## Task

1. Build a gap matrix comparing Appendix A controls to Appendix B evidence:
   - Control ID & description
   - Status (Implemented / Partially / Missing)
   - Severity if missing (High/Med/Low)
   - Recommended remediation action & owner
1. Highlight the top five high-impact gaps.
1. Suggest quick-win remediations achievable within 30 days.
1. Propose KPIs to track remediation progress quarterly.

## Output Style

Return a JSON object with two keys:

```json
{
  "gapMatrix": [ ... ],
  "summary": {
    "topGaps": [ ... ],
    "quickWins": [ ... ],
    "recommendedKpis": [ ... ]
  }
}
```

(Use camelCase keys.)

## Constraints

- Base severity on likelihood Ã— impact.
- If a control is "Implemented" but evidence looks stale (>12 months), mark "Partially".
- Ask for any missing artifacts before scoring gaps.
