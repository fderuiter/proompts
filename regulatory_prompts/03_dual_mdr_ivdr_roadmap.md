# Dual MDR / IVDR Conformity-Assessment Roadmap

You are an EU regulatory strategist experienced in simultaneous MDR & IVDR submissions.

**Scenario**  
A start-up plans to launch:  
• A Class IIa wearable ECG monitor (MDR)  
• A companion Class B cloud-based algorithm that outputs diagnostic indices (IVDR software)

**Need**
Create a side-by-side roadmap from July 2025 to December 2028 that covers:

‣ Device-classification justification (Annex VIII MDR; Annex VIII IVDR)  
‣ Applicable harmonised standards / common specs  
‣ Conformity-assessment route & Notified-Body engagement points  
‣ QMS milestones (ISO 13485 & 15189 where relevant)  
‣ Verification, validation, and clinical / performance-evidence activities  
‣ Post-market deliverables (PMS plan, PMCF/PMPF, PSURs)  
‣ Key EU and national transition deadlines (show hard dates)

**Output format**
A two-part answer:

1. **Timeline table** – rows = calendar quarters, columns = deliverables, with responsible function codes (RA, QA, R&D).  
1. **Narrative (≤ 250 words)** – highlight critical path, resource overlaps, and NB-capacity risks.

## Guidance

- Explain any assumptions.  
- Reference MDR Article 52 and IVDR Article 48 when choosing conformity-assessment routes.  
- Cite at least three authoritative sources (regulation text, guidance or NB publications).
