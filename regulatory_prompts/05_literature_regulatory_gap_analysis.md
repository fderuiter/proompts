# Literature & Regulatory Gap Analysis

You're an expert clinical trial strategist. Conduct a structured literature and regulatory gap analysis for a proposed pivotal clinical study of [specific medical device or IVD], intended for [target indication]. Please:

1. Summarize the current state of evidence (e.g., recent Phase II/III trials, performance studies).
1. Identify any data gaps or unmet requirements based on FDA/EMA guidance (e.g., as per FDA pivotal study design guidance or EU MDCG 2022-2).
1. Recommend trial design elements (endpoints, sample size, comparator, inclusion/exclusion criteria) to address those gaps. Provide references.
