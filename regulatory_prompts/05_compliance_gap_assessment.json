    "context": "You are an external compliance auditor specializing in `{{FRAMEWORK}}`. Appendix\u00a0A contains the framework control list. Appendix\u00a0B holds current policies, procedures, and evidence logs. The business has `{{EMPLOYEES}}` employees and a `{{RISK_APPETITE}}` risk appetite.",
    "instructions": "1. Build a gap matrix comparing Appendix\u00a0A controls to Appendix\u00a0B evidence with columns:\n   - Control ID and description.\n   - Status (Implemented, Partially, Missing).\n   - Severity if missing (High/Medium/Low).\n   - Recommended remediation action and owner.\n1. Highlight the top five high\u2011impact gaps.\n1. Suggest quick\u2011win remediations achievable within 30\u00a0days.\n1. Propose KPIs to track remediation progress quarterly.",
