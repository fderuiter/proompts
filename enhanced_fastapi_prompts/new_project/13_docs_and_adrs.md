# 13. Project Documentation and Decision Records

**Objective:**
Establish a strong foundation of documentation from the project's inception, including a comprehensive `README`, contribution guidelines, and a process for recording Architectural Decision Records (ADRs).

**Context:**
- **Primary Docs:** `README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`
- **PR Template:** `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`
- **ADR Directory:** `docs/adr/`

**Agent Instructions:**
-   The documentation should make it possible for a new developer to get up and running in under an hour with no outside help.
-   ADRs should be used to capture the "why" behind key technical choices as they are made.

**Tasks:**

1.  **Flesh out the `README.md`:**
    -   Expand the initial `README.md` to be a complete guide.
    -   Include:
        -   A clear project description and its purpose.
        -   Badges for CI, coverage, etc. (as they become available).
        -   **Prerequisites:** e.g., Docker, `make`.
        -   **Quickstart Guide:** The `make up` instructions.
        -   **Available Commands:** A table explaining all `make` targets (`test`, `lint`, etc.).
        -   **Architecture Overview:** A brief description of the project's structure (API, services, repositories).
        -   **Configuration:** Explain how settings and the `.env` file work.

2.  **Create `CONTRIBUTING.md`:**
    -   Create a `CONTRIBUTING.md` file to explain the development workflow.
    -   Include sections on:
        -   How to create a new branch (`feature/...`, `bugfix/...`).
        -   The importance of running `make test` and `make lint` before pushing.
        -   The Pull Request process.
        -   Coding style and conventions.

3.  **Create a `PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`:**
    -   Create a `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`.
    -   The template should prompt for:
        -   **Description:** What does this PR do? Why is it needed?
        -   **Related Issue:** Link to the GitHub issue.
        -   **Checklist:**
            -   `[ ]` I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works.
            -   `[ ]` I have updated the necessary documentation.
            -   `[ ]` I have run `make lint` and `make test` locally.

4.  **Initialize the ADR Process:**
    -   Create the `docs/adr/` directory.
    -   Create `0000-use-architectural-decision-records.md` to define the ADR process itself.
    -   Create the first decision record for a choice already made:
        -   `0001-choose-poetry-for-dependency-management.md` (or `pip-tools`).
    -   The ADR should cover:
        -   **Title:** e.g., "Use Poetry for Dependency Management"
        -   **Status:** Accepted
        -   **Context:** The problem is managing Python dependencies reproducibly.
        -   **Decision:** We chose Poetry.
        -   **Consequences:** All developers must use Poetry; we get a single `pyproject.toml` and lockfile; etc.

**Deliverables:**
-   A comprehensive `README.md` file.
-   A new `CONTRIBUTING.md` file.
-   A new `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` file.
-   The `docs/adr/` directory with the process definition and the first ADR.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
-   The `README.md` contains a complete, clear guide for a new developer to start the project.
-   The `CONTRIBUTING.md` clearly explains the development workflow.
-   Opening a new pull request automatically populates the description with the content from the template.
-   The ADR directory is initialized correctly, and the first ADR documents a key project decision.
-   A new team member can successfully set up the project and run the tests by only following the `README.md`.
