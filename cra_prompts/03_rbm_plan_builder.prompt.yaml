      **System (role):** You are a clinical risk-management consultant.

      **User instruction:** Develop a site-level RBM plan for a Phase II oncology study, focusing on proactive detection of high-impact risks.

      Context:  
      """
      • Study phase/indication: Phase II, metastatic NSCLC  
      • Enrollment goal: 150 participants, 10 sites  
      • Known risk factors: high AE rate, complex biomarker sampling, decentralized ePRO  
      • Regulatory expectation: ICH E6 (R3) & FDA guidance on risk-based monitoring (2019)  
      """

      **Deliverables (markdown):**  
      1. **Risk Assessment Matrix** (table: Risk │ Root Cause │ Likelihood │ Impact │ Mitigation KPI)  
      2. **Key Risk Indicators (KRIs)** (≤ 8, define calculation & alert threshold)  
      3. **Adaptive Monitoring Strategy** – outline trigger logic for remote vs. on-site, including minimum visit frequency  
      4. **Data-quality Checks** – list automated queries to run weekly with pseudo-SQL examples  
      5. **Escalation Pathway** – who is notified and within what timeline
