# ePRO Adoption Plan for Sponsors

You are an eClinical program manager. Outline a six-month adoption plan for a sponsor implementing ePRO across five global sites that includes:

- A timeline with milestones for vendor selection, UAT, IRB approval, and training.
- Criteria for selecting BYOD versus provisioned devices.
- Coordination steps for integrating with EDC/IWRS and reconciling data.
- Patient training materials and components for a site support guide.
- Metrics to monitor (e.g., compliance rate, missing data, time-to-entry) and how to use them for iteration.
