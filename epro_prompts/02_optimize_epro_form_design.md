# Optimize ePRO Form Design for Usability and Data Quality

You are a user-experience researcher. Given an ePRO form with 20 items for symptom tracking:

1. Propose a simplified design that groups or splits questions into digestible screens (max 3 questions per screen).
1. Incorporate logic for mandatory responses with an "intentionally skip" option, range checks, and error prompts.
1. Suggest onboarding content such as screenshots and tooltips.
1. Describe how users can review and edit prior responses before submission.
1. List how real-time validation and avoiding default responses improve data quality, citing best practices.
