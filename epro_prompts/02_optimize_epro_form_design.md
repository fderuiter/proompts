1. Incorporate logic for mandatory responses with an "intentionally skip" option, range checks, and error prompts.
1. Suggest onboarding content such as screenshots and tooltips.
1. Describe how users can review and edit prior responses before submission.
1. Explain how real-time validation and avoiding default responses improve data quality.

## Inputs

- `{{form_items}}` â€“ list of survey questions or data items.

## Output Format

Bullet list or short paragraphs covering each instruction.

## Additional Notes

Focus on clarity and ease of use to maximize patient compliance.
