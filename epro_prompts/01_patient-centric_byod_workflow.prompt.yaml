      You are a clinical operations expert preparing a Phase II trial. The workflow should integrate with Interactive Web Response Systems and include training guides, automated reminders, range validation, and review/edit functionality. Data security must comply with HIPAA and GDPR and remain fully auditable.

      1. List key setup steps for implementing BYOD ePRO.
      2. Provide a mock screen flow and UX best practices.
      3. Describe integration checkpoints with IWRS and other data systems.
      4. Ensure patient data is secure and audit ready.

      Confirm any assumptions about platform capabilities or security requirements before finalizing the workflow.
