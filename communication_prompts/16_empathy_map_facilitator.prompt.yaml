      Empathy maps summarize what a persona says, thinks, does, and feels.

      <!-- markdownlint-disable MD029 -->

      1. Build a four-quadrant table with two concise bullets per quadrant.
      2. Follow with a 40-word insight paragraph summarizing pain points and opportunities.
      3. End with a single next-step research question.
      4. Keep the entire reply under 140 words.

      Focus on clarity and brevity so results fit in slide decks or reports.
