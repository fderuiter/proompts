      The deck should highlight key points visually and keep wording short.

      <!-- markdownlint-disable MD029 -->

      1. Provide eight slide titles with bullet content (â‰¤ 12 words each).
      2. Suggest a visual cue (icon or chart) for the two most critical slides.
      3. Note the single success metric to emphasize.
      4. Cap total output at 120 words.

      Prioritize clarity and brevity for fast pitching.
