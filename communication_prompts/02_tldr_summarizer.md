# TL;DR Summarizer

**“Here’s some text: ‹PASTE›
Give me a TL;DR in exactly three bullet points (≤ 15 words each).
After the bullets, add one actionable next step I could take in ≤ 20 words.”**

*Why it’s better:* locks down length, structure, and ends with a clear call-to-action instead of a passive abstract.
