      The caller supplies `{{complex_topic}}`. The reply must stay under 120 words.

      1. Create three analogies linking everyday objects to `{{complex_topic}}`.
      2. **Bold** each object and map its parts to the concept in 40 words or fewer.
      3. Provide one real-life scenario showing the analogy's usefulness.
      4. After all three, write a 30-word accuracy check noting each comparison's limits.
