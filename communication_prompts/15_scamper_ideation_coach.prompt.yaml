      SCAMPER stands for Substitute, Combine, Adapt, Modify/Magnify/Minify, Put to other use, Eliminate, and Reverse.

      <!-- markdownlint-disable MD029 -->

      1. Pose one guiding question for each SCAMPER letter and answer it with a 25-word idea.
      2. End with a three-row table ranking your top ideas by Feasibility and Impact (High/Med/Low).
      3. Keep total output under 180 words.

      Prioritize clarity and brevity so the user can apply ideas quickly.
