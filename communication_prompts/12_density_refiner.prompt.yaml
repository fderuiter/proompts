      Use Chain-of-Density summarization to tighten coverage without length creep.

      <!-- markdownlint-disable MD029 -->

      1. Produce an entity-sparse gist in 120 words or fewer.
      2. List missing key nouns in 40 words or fewer.
      3. Rewrite a denser summary under 120 words using those nouns.
      4. End with a 15-word reflection on what detail improved.
      5. Label sections **Gist**, **Missing Entities**, **Dense Summary**, and **Reflection**.

      Chain-of-Density helps retain key entities while keeping the summary short.
