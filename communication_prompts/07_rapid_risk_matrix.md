# Rapid-Risk-Matrix

**“Act as a risk-manager. Objective: assess “[PROJECT/PROCESS]”.
• List 5–8 key risks.
• Build a table with columns: Risk, Likelihood (1-5), Impact (1-5), Raw-Score (L×I), Mitigation.
• Sort the table by highest Raw-Score.
• Follow with a 100-word narrative on the top two risks and how to monitor them.”**

*Why it rocks:* Risk-scoring tables are showing up in “100 best prompts of 2025” lists because they translate classic probability-impact matrices into a single copy-paste block.
