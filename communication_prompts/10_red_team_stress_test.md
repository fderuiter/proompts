# Red-Team Stress-Test

**“Form a red-team panel of 3 experts (Technical Hacker, Ruthless Competitor CEO, Regulatory Officer).
Scenario: “[IDEA / STRATEGY]”.

1. Each expert lists their top 2 attack vectors.
1. Consolidate attacks into a ranked list by severity.
1. For the top 3 attacks, propose a mitigation playbook (≤ 50 words each).
1. End with one metric to track that signals the mitigation is working.”**
