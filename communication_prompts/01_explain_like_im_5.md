# Explain-Like-I’m-5 (ELI5)

**“Explain ‘[TOPIC]’ as if I’m five:

1. Start with a playful analogy I’d know from kindergarten.
1. Use plain words—no sentence longer than 15 words.
1. Give three everyday examples that show why it matters.
   Finish with a one-sentence ‘grown-up’ summary (≤ 20 words).”**

*Why it’s better:* specifies tone, vocabulary ceiling, example count, and an executive summary so adults can share it onward.
