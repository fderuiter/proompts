# Storyboard-My-Idea

**“Storyboard “[PROJECT OR MESSAGE]” for a 60-second explainer video:

1. Generate exactly 6 frames.
1. For each frame give (a) scene description, (b) on-screen text ≤ 15 words, (c) suggested voice-over ≤ 20 words.
1. End with a one-sentence emotional takeaway for the viewer.”**

*Why it rocks:* Storyboarding used to be a designer-only skill, but creator blogs now recommend a structured, frame-by-frame prompt to crank out draft visuals in minutes.
