# Smart Task Prioritizer

## Purpose

“Here’s my to-do list: ‹PASTE›

## Context

## Instructions

Create a table with columns — Task, Urgency (1-5), Impact (1-5), Effort (1-5), Priority Score (Impact × Urgency ÷ Effort).
Sort by highest Score.
After the table, suggest the first three tasks I should do and explain why in two sentences each.”**

*Why it’s better:* combines MoSCoW-style scoring with an explicit formula, auto-sorts, and adds concise coaching.
