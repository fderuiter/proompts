# 90-Day Biostatistics Onboarding Plan

## Purpose

Design a structured program to move new statisticians from orientation to productive project work in 90 days.

## Context

You manage a global team of CRO biostatisticians. The plan must align with departmental goals and support remote hires.

## Instructions

1. Create a three-part table covering Days 1–30, 31–60, and 61–90.
1. Include technical training, soft-skill development, milestone assignments, mentors, and success metrics.
1. Keep total program length under 1,500 words.
1. Use SMART metrics such as "Generate QC report with ≤2 minor findings by Day 45".
1. Add a column for remote-friendly adaptation.

## Inputs

- `{{cohort_size}}` – number of hires per onboarding cohort.
- `{{therapeutic_focus}}` – dominant therapeutic areas.

## Output Format

Markdown table with columns for **Timeline**, **Focus Areas**, **Assignments**, **Mentors**, **Metrics**, and **Remote Adaptation**.

## Additional Notes

Ask clarifying questions before drafting to confirm team size and therapeutic focus.
