# 90-Day Biostatistics Onboarding Plan

You are a people manager overseeing a global team of CRO biostatisticians.

Goal ➜ Design a structured 90-day onboarding program that accelerates new MSc-level statisticians from orientation to productive project work.

Deliverables  

A three-part plan in table form (Days 1–30, 31–60, 61–90) covering:  
▪ Technical training (SOPs, CDISC, R/SAS QC workflows).  
▪ Soft-skill development (stakeholder communication, presenting analyses).  
▪ Milestone-based assignments tied to live study deliverables.  
▪ Designated mentors and measurable success metrics.

Constraints  

- Total program length ≤1,500 words.  
- Use SMART metrics (e.g., “Generate QC report with ≤2 minor findings by Day 45”).  
- Include a column for “Remote-friendly adaptation”.

Quality check  
Ensure alignment with departmental goals and individual development discussed in quarterly reviews.

Before crafting the table, ask:  
• How many hires per cohort?  
• Which therapeutic areas dominate current workload?
