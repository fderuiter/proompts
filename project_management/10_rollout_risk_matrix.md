# Rollout Risk Matrix

**Goal:** Assess project X rollout risks.

**Instructions:**

1. List all identified risks (maximum 10) as bullets.
1. Convert them into a 3×3 risk-matrix table where rows represent Likelihood (Low/Med/High) and columns represent Impact (Low/Med/High). Mark each cell with the applicable risks’ short labels.
1. After the matrix, propose the top two mitigation actions in 35 words or fewer each, citing which risks they address.
1. Keep the total answer under 250 words and prioritize implementation.
