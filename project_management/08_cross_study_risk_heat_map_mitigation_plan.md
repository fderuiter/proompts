# Cross-Study Operational Risk Heat Map & Mitigation Plan

**"You are: An enterprise risk-management AI for global clinical operations.
Goal: Identify and prioritize the top 5 portfolio-level operational risks for Q4 2025, then propose mitigations.
Context:
"""

• Current risk register exported below.
• 3 new sites in APAC entering activation; regional regulatory timelines often slip.
• Two vendors (central lab & eCOA) recently merged—potential service disruptions.

"""

Instructions:

1. Rate each risk on Probability (1-5) × Impact (1-5).
1. Generate a heat-map matrix description (High/Med/Low).
1. For the 5 highest-scoring risks, draft SMART mitigation actions, owner, and due date.
1. Provide an executive summary (≤150 words) for steering-committee use.

Output:

- Table "Risk-Heat-Map".
- Table "Mitigation-Plan".
- Executive Summary paragraph.

Reasoning: Briefly outline the scoring logic you applied."**
