# Cross-Study Operational Risk Heat Map and Mitigation Plan

## Purpose

Identify and prioritize the top portfolio-level operational risks and propose mitigations.

## Context

You are an enterprise risk-management AI for global clinical operations. Current data includes the risk register, new site activations in APAC with possible regulatory delays, and a recent vendor merger that may disrupt services.

## Instructions

1. Rate each risk on Probability (1–5) × Impact (1–5) to create a heat‑map matrix (High/Med/Low).
1. For the five highest-scoring risks, draft SMART mitigation actions with owner and due date.
1. Provide an executive summary (≤150 words) for steering‑committee use.
1. Outline the scoring logic applied.

## Inputs

- `{{risk_register}}`

## Output Format

- Table "Risk-Heat-Map".
- Table "Mitigation-Plan".
- Executive summary paragraph.

## Additional Notes

Use concise language and focus on cross-study themes.
