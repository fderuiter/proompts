# Scientific Overview

## Workflows
- **[Biological Safety Assessment and Planning](biological_safety.workflow.yaml)**: A workflow to perform a risk assessment for a medical device, develop a biological safety plan, and prepare for regulatory submission. This follows the sequence in the biological_safety_prompts directory.
- **[BioSkills Workflow](bioskills.workflow.yaml)**: A workflow for coaching, feedback, and assessment of bioskills.
- **[Chemical Characterization and Biocompatibility Assessment](chemical_characterization.workflow.yaml)**: A workflow to design a chemical characterization study, assess the risks from the results, and write a regulatory summary. This follows the sequence in the chemical_characterization_prompts directory.
- **[Microbiology Workflow](microbiology.workflow.yaml)**: A workflow for creating a bioburden testing SOP, an EO sterilization validation protocol, and an endotoxin control risk plan.
- **[Preclinical Pathology Study Workflow](pathology_study.workflow.yaml)**: A workflow to design a pathology study protocol, evaluate the device-tissue interface, and plan the slide reporting. This follows the sequence in the pathology_prompts directory.
- **[Sterility Workflow](sterility.workflow.yaml)**: A workflow for building a sterility validation protocol, comparing regulatory gaps, and performing a process FMEA.
