# Clinical Overview

## Workflows
- **[Adjudication Workflow](adjudication.workflow.yaml)**: A workflow to design an adjudication dashboard, create a source document checklist, and analyze adjudication KPIs.
- **[Clinical Data Workflow](clinical_data.workflow.yaml)**: A workflow for detecting discrepancies, drafting a DMP section, and building edit check specifications.
- **[Clinical Monitoring Workflow](clinical_monitoring.workflow.yaml)**: A workflow for creating a site performance dashboard, building a CAPA plan, and critiquing a monitoring visit report.
- **[Clinical Prompts Workflow](clinical_prompts.workflow.yaml)**: A workflow to generate a CRF shell, audit it, and create a CDASH mapping guide.
- **[Clinical Safety Workflow](clinical_safety.workflow.yaml)**: A workflow for creating a clinical safety synopsis, an adverse event narrative, and trending safety signals.
- **[CRA Workflow](cra.workflow.yaml)**: A workflow for generating a monitoring visit report, tracking investigator follow-up emails, and building an RBM plan.
- **[Clinical ETL Pipeline Design and Review](data_management_etl.workflow.yaml)**: A workflow to create an ETL mapping spec, define QC transformations, and review the final pipeline. This follows the sequence in the data_management_prompts directory (04, 05, 06).

- **[Imaging Workflow](imaging.workflow.yaml)**: A workflow for various imaging-related tasks, including charter drafting, QC, central reading design, and regulatory packaging.
- **[Compassionate Music Therapy Workflow](music_therapy.workflow.yaml)**: A 4-step workflow to deconstruct venting, plan a therapeutic arc, compose a musical blueprint, and write lyrics.
- **[Protocol Workflow](protocol.workflow.yaml)**: A workflow to create, review, and refine a clinical trial protocol.
- **[RTSM Workflow](rtsm.workflow.yaml)**: A workflow for designing a randomization scheme, a supply strategy, and a risk-based monitoring SOP.
- **[Site Acquisition Workflow](site_acquisition.workflow.yaml)**: A workflow for site landscape mapping, feasibility questionnaire building, and investigator outreach.
- **[Protocol to USDM Workflow](usdm_workflow.workflow.yaml)**: A 5-stage chain to convert unstructured Clinical Protocol text into CDISC USDM v3.0 JSON.
