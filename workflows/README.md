# Workflow Library 🔄

Welcome to the Workflow Library! This directory contains orchestration definitions that chain multiple prompts together to achieve complex, multi-step goals.

## Directory Map 🗺️

The workflows are organized by domain, mirroring the structure of the prompt library.

| Directory | Domain | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[`business/`](./business)** | Business | Workflows for **Finance**, **Market Research**, and corporate strategy. |
| **[`clinical/`](./clinical)** | Clinical | Extensive clinical trial workflows including **Adjudication**, **Monitoring**, **Data Management**, **Safety**, and **Protocol Development**. |
| **[`management/`](./management)** | Management | Workflows for **Project Management**, **Leadership**, and **Training**. |
| **[`meta/`](./meta)** | Meta | Meta-workflows for prompt engineering and self-improvement. |
| **[`scientific/`](./scientific)** | Scientific | Scientific workflows for **Microbiology**, **Sterility**, and **Biosafety**. |
| **[`technical/`](./technical)** | Technical | technical workflows for **Software Engineering**, **Testing**, and **Data Science**. |

## Workflow Structure 🏗️

Workflows are defined in `.workflow.yaml` files. Each workflow consists of:

- **Inputs**: Global inputs required to start the workflow.
- **Steps**: A sequence of steps, where each step executes a prompt.
  - **`step_id`**: Unique identifier for the step.
  - **`prompt_file`**: Path to the prompt file (relative to repository root).
  - **`map_inputs`**: Mapping of workflow inputs or previous step outputs to the prompt's inputs.

## Execution 🚀

You can run workflows using the `run_workflow.py` script.

```bash
# Example: Run the Agentic Coding workflow
python3 tools/scripts/run_workflow.py workflows/technical/agentic_coding.workflow.yaml -i product_concept="A new time-tracking app"
```

## Documentation 📄

Each workflow file has a corresponding `.md` file (e.g., `agentic_coding.workflow.md`) containing a visual flowchart generated by `tools/scripts/generate_workflow_diagrams.py`.
