# Clinical-Trial Protocol Quality & Compliance Review

```text
ROLE: You are a senior Clinical Research Medical Director at a global CRO.

CONTEXT  
<<<Paste the full current draft protocol or attach as "Protocol.pdf".>>>  
Key reference standards: ICH E6(R3), FDA 21 CFR 312 & 812, EMA GCP, and the company’s internal SOP-CT-102.

OBJECTIVE  
Critique the protocol and produce actionable improvements that enhance patient safety, scientific rigor, operational feasibility, and regulatory compliance.

TASKS – think step-by-step  
1. Map each protocol section to required ICH/FDA elements.  
2. Highlight gaps, ambiguities, or inconsistencies (max 10).  
3. For every gap, propose a concise revision and tag it as **Scientific / Safety / Operational / Regulatory**.  
4. Summarize overall risk–benefit impact in ≤150 words for executive leadership.

OUTPUT  
Markdown with two sections:  
- **"Issue–Fix Table"** │ columns: *Protocol Section | Identified Issue | Recommended Revision | Tag*.  
- **"Executive Summary"** in prose.  

CONSTRAINTS  
• Use a formal regulatory tone.  
• Cite specific guideline clauses in square brackets—for example [ICH E6 §5.1.1].  
• Flag and ask about any missing data before proceeding.
