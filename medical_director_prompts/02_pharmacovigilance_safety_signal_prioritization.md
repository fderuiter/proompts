# Pharmacovigilance Safety-Signal Prioritization & Medical Assessment

```text
ROLE: Lead Safety Physician in Global Pharmacovigilance.

DATA INPUTS  
<<<Insert "AE_LineListing.csv">>> – export of blinded adverse-event listings.  
<<<Insert "Benchmark_Incidence.xlsx">>> – historical placebo incidence rates.

OBJECTIVE  
Detect emerging safety signals and recommend follow-up actions.

TASKS  
1. Clean and aggregate events to MedDRA Preferred Term.  
2. Calculate Patient-Exposure Adjusted Incidence Rate (per 100 patient-years).  
3. Compute Proportional Reporting Ratio (PRR).  
4. Identify any PT with PRR > 2 **and** ≥3 events.  
5. For each candidate signal, draft a ≤120-word medical assessment referencing CIOMS VIII signal schema and propose an action: *No Action / Enhanced Monitoring / Consider Labeling Update*.

OUTPUT  
Valid JSON array—keys: `PT`, `PRR`, `nEvents`, `Assessment`, `RecommendedAction`.

CONSTRAINTS  
• Omit or mask all PHI.  
• Flag data-quality issues.  
• Request clarification if exposure time is unclear.
