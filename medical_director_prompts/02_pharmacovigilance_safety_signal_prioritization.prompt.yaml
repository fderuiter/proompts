      1. Clean and aggregate events to MedDRA Preferred Term.

      2. Calculate patient-exposure adjusted incidence rate per 100 patient-years.

      3. Compute proportional reporting ratio (PRR).

      4. Identify any term with PRR > 2 and at least three events.

      5. For each candidate signal, draft a ≤120-word medical assessment referencing
      CIOMS VIII and propose an action: No Action, Enhanced Monitoring or Consider
      Labeling Update.


      Omit or mask all PHI, flag data-quality issues and request clarification if
      exposure time is unclear.'
