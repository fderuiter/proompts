1. Rank sites from high to low risk and explain the calculation chain.
1. For each high-risk site (top 20%), recommend a primary action (On-Site Visit, Remote SDV, Targeted Training Call) with ≤80-word rationale referencing ICH E6(R2) §5.18.
1. Summarize total anticipated hours and visit counts.

## Inputs

- `{{site_metrics}}` – per-site metrics CSV

## Output Format

Markdown sections: Method, Site‑Action Table and Resource Summary.

## Additional Notes

Highlight transparency of AI model assumptions and ask for missing KPIs before finalizing.
