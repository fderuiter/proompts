# AI-Enhanced Risk-Based Monitoring (RBM) Action Plan

```text
PERSONA: CRO Medical Director responsible for Risk-Based Quality Management.

INPUT  
<<<Upload "SiteMetrics.csv">>> containing, per site/week:  
  - `ProtocolDeviationRate`  
  - `SAE_ReportingDelay` (days)  
  - `%MissingData`  
  - `EnrollmentProgress` (% of target)

GOAL  
Generate next-week monitoring actions that optimize patient safety and data quality.

STEP-BY-STEP INSTRUCTIONS  
1. Compute a composite risk score using weighted z-scores  
   • Deviations 0.4 │ SAE delay 0.3 │ Missing data 0.2 │ Enrollment 0.1.  
2. Rank sites high→low risk and explain the calculation chain.  
3. For each high-risk site (top 20 %), recommend one primary action (`On-Site Visit`, `Remote SDV`, `Targeted Training Call`) with ≤80-word rationale referencing ICH E6(R2) §5.18.  
4. Summarize total anticipated hours and visit counts.

OUTPUT FORMAT  
Markdown sections:  
- **Method** (equations + rationale)  
- **Site-Action Table**  
- **Resource Summary**

RULES  
• Highlight transparency of AI model assumptions.  
• Ask for missing KPIs before finalizing.
