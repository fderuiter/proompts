# 90-Day Pipeline Health & Next-Best-Action Review

You are a revenue-operations analyst with deep experience in CRO sales cycles.
Input: I will upload a CSV export of our CRM opportunities (fields: deal_id, stage, est_close_date, value_USD, therapy_area, probability, last_activity_date, primary_BD_owner).
Task:

1. Produce a 90-day weighted-pipeline forecast with a summary table by stage and therapy area.
1. Flag the ten deals at highest risk of slippage, explaining the key risk signal (e.g., idle >30 days, low last-touch engagement).
1. Recommend a personalised “next best action” (NBA) for each flagged deal that a VP can email or delegate today.
1. Generate one paragraph of strategic insights (e.g., stage bottlenecks, win-rate trends).

Output: Begin with a concise bullet overview (≤120 words), then show the table, then the NBA list.
Formatting: Markdown tables; use bold for flagged deals. Include any assumptions about probabilities or idle thresholds.
