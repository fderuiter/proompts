## Purpose

Assess the health of the sales pipeline and recommend next-best actions.

2. Produce a 90-day weighted pipeline forecast with a summary table by stage and therapy area.
3. Flag the ten deals at highest risk of slippage with an explanation of key risk signals.
4. Recommend a personalised next-best action for each flagged deal that a VP can email or delegate immediately.
5. Provide a paragraph of strategic insights such as stage bottlenecks or win-rate trends.

## Inputs

- `{{crm_csv}}`

## Output Format

Markdown summary tables followed by bullet-point recommendations.

## Additional Notes
