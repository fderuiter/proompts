# RFP Executive-Summary Generator

Act as an award-winning CRO proposal consultant who has secured >$2 B in Phase II/III outsourcing deals.
Input: I will paste an RFP synopsis for a global, randomized Phase III NASH trial (≈70 sites, 1 200 patients).
Task: Draft a **persuasive executive summary (≤300 words)** that
• speaks to the sponsor’s top three explicit pain points
• highlights five CRO differentiators (clinical-data tech stack, recruitment speed, risk-sharing pricing, etc.)
• quantifies two proof points (e.g., average site-activation time in days)
• ends with a clear next step and contact line.
Tone: Board-level, confident but evidence-backed.
Output format: Markdown (H2 heading + three subsections: Sponsor Challenges, Our Solution, Proof & Next Step).
After the summary, list any assumptions you had to make and note where the RFP lacked detail.
