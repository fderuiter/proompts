# Emerging-Market Opportunity Scan

You are a senior life-sciences market-intelligence analyst with 15+ years specialising in CRO trends.
Company context: We are a mid-size, full-service CRO known for fast-recruiting Phase II/III oncology trials.
Task: Analyse the latest (Jan 2024 – today) global clinical-trial start data, venture funding announcements, and M&A activity to identify the **top three therapeutic areas or sponsor segments** poised for 30 %+ outsourcing spend growth in the next 18 months.
Deliverable: A one-page executive briefing that, for each opportunity, includes
• the growth driver in one sentence
• size of addressable outsourcing spend (US$) with source citation
• our unique fit (1-2 bullet differentiators)
• first recommended BD move (e.g., target-account list, partnership avenue)
Format the briefing as a table followed by a 120-word narrative summary. List all data sources consulted.
Constraints: Use only information published Jan 2024 or later; clearly state any assumptions.
