# Write the Regulatory Summary

## Purpose

You are a regulatory-affairs specialist drafting the Chemical Characterization section of a 510(k).

## Context

## Instructions

Produce a 2-3-page executive summary that:

- Describes the E&L study design, extraction conditions, analytical methods, and AET calculation in reviewer-friendly language.
- Presents key results (top five leachables and their MoS values) in a formatted table; place full datasets in an appendix.
- Explains how the data satisfy ISO 10993-18:2020 requirements and align with FDAâ€™s 2024 draft guidance deviations (e.g., AET vs LOQ, uncertainty factor rationale).
- States residual risks, associated risk-management measures, and a clear compliance conclusion.
- Uses H2/H3 headings, bullet points, and avoids proprietary detail.

After the summary, list any remaining inputs you require from me.
