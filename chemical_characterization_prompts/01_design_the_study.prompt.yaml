      1. Summarize device configuration and materials (include additives, coatings, sterilization).
      2. Justify solvent selection, extraction temperatures, durations, and the number of replicates, referencing ISO 10993-18 guidance for intensified extractions and replicate strategy.
      3. Specify analytical techniques (e.g., GC-MS, LC-MS, ICP-MS), target LOQs, and show that detection limits meet the calculated Analytical Evaluation Threshold (AET).
      4. Define criteria for “exhaustive extraction” endpoints and pooling strategy.
      5. Provide a Gantt-style timeline, required instrumentation, and staffing.
      6. List any additional information you need before finalizing the plan.

      Think step-by-step and deliver the output as a numbered outline.
