      Produce a 2-3-page executive summary that:

      - Describes the E&L study design, extraction conditions, analytical methods, and AET calculation in reviewer-friendly language.
      - Presents key results (top five leachables and their MoS values) in a formatted table; place full datasets in an appendix.
      - Explains how the data satisfy ISO 10993-18:2020 requirements and align with FDAâ€™s 2024 draft guidance deviations (e.g., AET vs LOQ, uncertainty factor rationale).
      - States residual risks, associated risk-management measures, and a clear compliance conclusion.
      - Uses H2/H3 headings, bullet points, and avoids proprietary detail.

      After the summary, list any remaining inputs you require from me.
