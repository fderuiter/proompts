      I will supply the extractables/leachables results table that was generated per ISO 10993-18. Using those data:

      - Calculate the Analytical Evaluation Threshold (AET) given:
         - Patient body weight = {BW} kg
         - Clinical dose = {DEVICE-DOSE} µg day⁻¹
         - Show equations and intermediate steps.
      - Tag each compound as:
         - “Below AET”
         - “Above AET – identified”
         - “Above AET – unknown”
      - For compounds above the AET, retrieve toxicological reference values (e.g., TTC or DNEL), calculate the Margin of Safety (MoS), and flag any MoS < 1.
      - Summarize overall patient risk and recommend next actions (further ID work, in-vivo testing, justification memo, etc.).

      Return a markdown table of results followed by a concise narrative. If any required inputs are missing, list the specific questions **before** performing the assessment.
