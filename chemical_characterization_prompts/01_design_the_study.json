    "purpose": "You are a senior analytical chemist specializing in medical-device Extractables & Leachables (E&L). Using ISO 10993-18:2020 and FDA\u2019s 2024 draft \u201cChemical Analysis for Biocompatibility Assessment,\u201d create a detailed test plan for an exhaustive extractables study and a simulated-use leachables study of a {DEVICE TYPE / MATERIAL / INTENDED CONTACT TIME}. Your plan must:",
    "context": "",
    "instructions": "1. Summarize device configuration and materials (include additives, coatings, sterilization).\n1. Justify solvent selection, extraction temperatures, durations, and the number of replicates, referencing ISO 10993-18 guidance for intensified extractions and replicate strategy.\n1. Specify analytical techniques (e.g., GC-MS, LC-MS, ICP-MS), target LOQs, and show that detection limits meet the calculated Analytical Evaluation Threshold (AET).\n1. Define criteria for \u201cexhaustive extraction\u201d endpoints and pooling strategy.\n1. Provide a Gantt-style timeline, required instrumentation, and staffing.\n1. List any additional information you need before finalizing the plan.\n\nThink step-by-step and deliver the output as a numbered outline.",
