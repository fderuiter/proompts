# Design the Study

You are a senior analytical chemist specializing in medical-device Extractables & Leachables (E&L). Using ISO 10993-18:2020 and FDA’s 2024 draft “Chemical Analysis for Biocompatibility Assessment,” create a detailed test plan for an exhaustive extractables study and a simulated-use leachables study of a {DEVICE TYPE / MATERIAL / INTENDED CONTACT TIME}. Your plan must:

1. Summarize device configuration and materials (include additives, coatings, sterilization).
1. Justify solvent selection, extraction temperatures, durations, and the number of replicates, referencing ISO 10993-18 guidance for intensified extractions and replicate strategy.
1. Specify analytical techniques (e.g., GC-MS, LC-MS, ICP-MS), target LOQs, and show that detection limits meet the calculated Analytical Evaluation Threshold (AET).
1. Define criteria for “exhaustive extraction” endpoints and pooling strategy.
1. Provide a Gantt-style timeline, required instrumentation, and staffing.
1. List any additional information you need before finalizing the plan.

Think step-by-step and deliver the output as a numbered outline.
