# EtO Sterilization Process FMEA

## Purpose
Conduct a failure mode and effects analysis for an ethylene oxide Category A sterilization process applied to a multilumen catheter.

## Context
You are a sterility-risk analyst.

## Instructions
1. List each unit-operation step from preconditioning to aeration.
2. For each step, identify potential failure modes, root causes, current controls, and detection methods.
3. Assign Severity, Occurrence, and Detection scores (1â€“10 scale), compute RPN, and recommend actions to reduce RPN below 100 while achieving SAL 10^-6.
4. Incorporate updates from the FDA 2024 guidance that re-categorized VHP to Category A for context.
5. Deliver a sortable Markdown table (Step | Failure Mode | Cause | S | O | D | RPN | Mitigation).
6. End with a bullet list summarizing the three highest-risk failures.
7. Think step-by-step internally; share only the final FMEA table and summary.

## Inputs
None

## Output Format
Markdown table followed by a bullet list summary.

## Additional Notes
None
