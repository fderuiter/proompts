      - Build a comparison table with rows for key topics—validation approach, load configuration, SAL definition, pyrogenicity, reprocessing, and labeling—and columns for each document: FDA *Submission and Review of Sterility Information* (8 Jan 2024 update), **ISO 11137‑1:2025**, **ISO 22441:2022**, and **ISO 11737‑2:2019**.
      - Highlight any **gaps or divergences** and flag items required in a 510(k).
      - Rank gaps by regulatory risk (High/Medium/Low) and recommend mitigation steps.

      Inputs:
      - `{{device_description}}` – brief description of the device.

      Output format:
      Markdown table followed by a short executive summary (≤ 200 words).

      Additional notes:
      - Use bold red text `**<text>**` for high‑risk gaps.
      - Do not expose your chain of thought.
