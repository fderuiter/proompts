      Draft a complete validation protocol for a single-use Class II instrument
      sterilized by gamma irradiation.

    content: |-
      - Define worst-case product configuration and family grouping approach.
      - Design bioburden assessment, fractional/half-cycle verification, and VDmax method per **ISO 11137‑1:2025** and **ISO 11737‑2:2019**.
      - Calculate sample sizes and acceptance criteria to meet a PNSU ≤ 10^-6.
      - Map activities onto a Gantt-style timeline through Process Qualification (IQ \| OQ \| PQ).
      - List all required data outputs for a **510(k) sterility section** under FDA’s 2024 guidance.

      Inputs:
      - `{{device_description}}` – instrument details.

      Output format:
      Numbered sections: Overview, Materials, Methods, Acceptance Criteria, Timeline, and References.

      Additional notes:
      - Include all equations explicitly.
      - Cite each standard or guidance section by clause number.
      - Think through the solution step-by-step internally and reveal only the final protocol.
