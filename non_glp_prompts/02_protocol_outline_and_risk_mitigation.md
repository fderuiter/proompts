# Protocol Outline and Risk Mitigation

As a preclinical study design expert, outline a protocol for a non-GLP proof-of-concept study of [DEVICE_NAME] for [INDICATION]. Include:

• Study design (control vs treated groups).
• Dosing or device application strategy.
• Key measurements (imaging, biomarkers, functional tests).
• Risk minimization (animal welfare, experimental bias).
• Data analysis plan (statistical tests, acceptance criteria).

Then provide a brief rationale for each section.
