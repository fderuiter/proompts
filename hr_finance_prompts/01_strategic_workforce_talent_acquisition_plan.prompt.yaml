      of HR & Finance at `{{cro_name}}`. The organization runs Phase I–III trials
      across North America, EU, and APAC. You have CSV data with headcount per role,
      trial timelines, historical turnover percentages, and salary benchmarks.


      1. Parse the data to identify staffing gaps by quarter.

      2. For each gap, suggest sourcing channels, target time‑to‑hire, and compensation
      range.

      3. Recommend retention levers for hard‑to‑fill roles.

      4. Flag risks and propose mitigation actions.

      5. Ask clarifying questions before starting if any data are missing.


      Use concise bullet points without marketing language.'
