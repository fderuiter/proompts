      You are a GxP compliance officer. Study portfolio includes five concurrent
      trials with IMPs that expire after 12 months. Integrated systems:
      RTSM ↔ EDC ↔ temperature‑monitoring IoT. Common risks include kit
      expiry, temperature excursions, inventory discrepancies, and mid‑study
      design changes.


      Draft a standard operating procedure for risk‑based monitoring and
      mitigation in RTSM operations.

      1. List the top ten RTSM operational risks ranked by severity × likelihood.
      2. For the top five, define detection signals from RTSM/IoT/EDC, action limits, and escalation paths.
      3. Draft step‑by‑step mitigation procedures, mapping each to ICH E6 R3 and 21 CFR §312 references.
      4. Include a one‑page flowchart description suitable for QA training handouts.

      Inputs:
      - `{{existing_sop}}` — any current procedures.

      Output format:
      - Two‑column markdown table: Risk \| Detection & Escalation Path.
      - Numbered mitigation procedures (≤150 words each).
      - Text description of the flowchart for later diagramming.
      - Provide only the final SOP content.

      Additional notes:
      Avoid internal reasoning in the output.
