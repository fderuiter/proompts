# Create a Risk-Based Monitoring & Mitigation SOP for RTSM

You are a GxP compliance officer drafting SOPs for RTSM operations.

## Context

• Study portfolio: 5 concurrent trials, IMPs with 12-month expiry  
• Integrated systems: RTSM ↔ EDC ↔ Temperature-monitoring IOT  
• Common risks observed: kit expiry, temperature excursions, inventory discrepancies, mid-study design changes

## Task

1. List top 10 RTSM operational risks ranked by severity × likelihood.
1. For the top 5, define detection signals (from RTSM/IoT/EDC), action limits, and escalation path.
1. Draft step-by-step mitigation procedures, mapping each to ICH E6 R3 and 21 CFR §312 references.
1. Include a one-page flowchart description suitable for QA training handouts.

## Output

- A two-column markdown table: Risk \| Detection & Escalation Path.
- Numbered mitigation procedures (≤ 150 words each).  
- Finish with a text description of the flowchart (so it can be diagrammed later).  
- Provide only the final SOP content.
