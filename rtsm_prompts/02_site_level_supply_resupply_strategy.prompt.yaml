      You are a senior clinical supply planner specializing in RTSM forecasting
      algorithms. Key parameters:


      - Trial: 18‑month adaptive dose‑escalation

      - Sites: 28 across US/EU/APAC

      - Average enrollment: 10 patients/site/month (Poisson λ = 10)

      - Packaging: 2‑visit kits (28‑day supply)

      - Lead times: 8 weeks manufacture + 2 weeks shipping

      - Depot capacities: USA, Germany, Singapore

      - Shelf‑life: 24 months, temperature‑controlled (2–8 °C)

      - Preferred strategy: trigger‑based resupply


      Plan site-level drug supply and resupply for an adaptive trial.
  - role: user
    content: |-
      1. Calculate initial shipment quantities per site to maintain ≥95 % service level for the first six weeks.
      1. Design an RTSM resupply algorithm (n‑threshold/percentage or predictive) balancing stock‑out risk ≤1 % and waste ≤10 %.
      1. Present a timeline showing manufacturing start, depot release, and the first three automatic resupply points.
      1. Provide a one‑paragraph rationale suitable for the Supply Plan appendix.

      Inputs:
      - `{{trial_enrollment}}` — actual enrollment data if available.

      Output format:
      - Markdown table with rows = sites and columns = initial kits, reorder threshold, expected monthly consumption, and safety stock.
      - Gantt‑style ASCII timeline.
      - Concluding rationale paragraph.

      Additional notes:
      Omit internal reasoning; provide only the final deliverable.
