    "purpose": "Draft a standard operating procedure for risk\u2011based monitoring and mitigation in RTSM operations.",
    "context": "You are a GxP compliance officer. Study portfolio includes five concurrent trials with IMPs that expire after 12\u00a0months. Integrated systems: RTSM\u00a0\u2194\u00a0EDC\u00a0\u2194\u00a0temperature\u2011monitoring IoT. Common risks include kit expiry, temperature excursions, inventory discrepancies, and mid\u2011study design changes.",
    "instructions": "1. List the top ten RTSM operational risks ranked by severity \u00d7 likelihood.\n1. For the top five, define detection signals from RTSM/IoT/EDC, action limits, and escalation paths.\n1. Draft step\u2011by\u2011step mitigation procedures, mapping each to ICH\u00a0E6\u00a0R3 and 21\u00a0CFR \u00a7312 references.\n1. Include a one\u2011page flowchart description suitable for QA training handouts.",

    "output_format": "- Two\u2011column markdown table: Risk\u00a0\\| Detection & Escalation Path.\n- Numbered mitigation procedures (\u2264150\u00a0words each).\n- Text description of the flowchart for later diagramming.\n- Provide only the final SOP content.",
