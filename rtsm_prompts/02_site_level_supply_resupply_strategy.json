    "context": "You are a senior clinical supply planner specializing in RTSM forecasting algorithms. Key parameters:\n\n- Trial: 18\u2011month adaptive dose\u2011escalation\n- Sites: 28 across US/EU/APAC\n- Average enrollment: 10 patients/site/month (Poisson \u03bb\u202f=\u202f10)\n- Packaging: 2\u2011visit kits (28\u2011day supply)\n- Lead times: 8\u00a0weeks manufacture + 2\u00a0weeks shipping\n- Depot capacities: USA, Germany, Singapore\n- Shelf\u2011life: 24\u00a0months, temperature\u2011controlled (2\u20138\u00a0\u00b0C)\n- Preferred strategy: trigger\u2011based resupply",
    "instructions": "1. Calculate initial shipment quantities per site to maintain \u226595\u00a0% service level for the first six weeks.\n1. Design an RTSM resupply algorithm (n\u2011threshold/percentage or predictive) balancing stock\u2011out risk \u22641\u00a0% and waste \u226410\u00a0%.\n1. Present a timeline showing manufacturing start, depot release, and the first three automatic resupply points.\n1. Provide a one\u2011paragraph rationale suitable for the Supply Plan appendix.",
