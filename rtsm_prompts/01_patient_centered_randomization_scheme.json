    "context": "You are an RTSM architect with 10\u00a0years of global Phase\u00a03 experience. Key study parameters:\n\n- Phase: 3\n- Sites: 42\n- Arms: active\u00a01 : placebo\u00a01\n- Stratification: region (3\u00a0levels) and prior therapy (yes/no)\n- Blinding: double\u2011dummy\n- Desired balance: 1:1 per stratum\n- Regulatory regions: FDA, EMA, PMDA",
    "instructions": "1. Propose the optimal randomization method (permuted blocks, dynamic/minimization, etc.).\n1. Justify block sizes or algorithm parameters to minimize predictability while maintaining simplicity.\n1. Draft a concise randomization specification (\u2264600\u00a0words) covering:\n   - Algorithm description and parameters.\n   - Seed management and audit\u2011trail requirements.\n   - Dummy\u2011code structure and masking plan.\n   - Simulation results showing expected imbalance <2 patients per arm within each stratum at N\u202f=\u202f600.",
