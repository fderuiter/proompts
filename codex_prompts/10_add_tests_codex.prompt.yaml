      - Repository is already set up with a test framework.
      - Caller lists target files requiring coverage.

      1. For each file in {{files}}, outline behaviours to test.
      2. Generate test stubs or full tests following project conventions.
      3. Run the test suite and linters; report failures.
      4. Suggest follow-up refactors if code is hard to test.
      5. Provide commands for reproducing results locally.

      If test dependencies are missing, note required installations or configuration changes.
