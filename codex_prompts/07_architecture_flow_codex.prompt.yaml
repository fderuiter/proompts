      - Repository includes client, server and data layers.
      - Caller specifies an HTTP endpoint or function entry point.

      1. Follow the call chain from the given entry point to persistence.
      2. List key modules, validations, and third-party services touched.
      3. Produce a `mermaidjs` sequence or flow diagram.
      4. Highlight potential bottlenecks or failure points.
      5. Suggest questions for deeper audits if pieces of the path are unclear.

      Use greppable identifiers for functions and files so users can cross-reference quickly.
