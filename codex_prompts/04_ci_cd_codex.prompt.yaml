      - Tooling & tests are in place.
      - Deployment targets could be Vercel, AWS ECS/Fargate, Fly.io, or plain Docker Compose on a VM.
      - Secrets will include `OPENAI_API_KEY`.

      **Ask the caller**:

      1. Environments (dev / staging / prod).
      2. Deployment platform and region.
      3. Secret-management preference (GitHub Encrypted Secrets, AWS Secrets Manager, Vault…).
      4. Versioning scheme (SemVer via `release-please`, CalVer, etc.).

      Then scaffold:

      - `ci.yml` → lint + test + build.
      - `release.yml` → auto-tag & changelog.
      - `deploy-<env>.yml` files → fetch artifact, deploy, smoke-test endpoint that internally calls OpenAI with an `echo` prompt "ping".
      - Docs in `docs/deploy.md` describing how to add secrets.

      Return all workflow YAML and any helper shell scripts as code blocks.

      - Cache deps with `actions/cache@v4`.
      - Matrix test on multiple Node/Python versions if applicable.
