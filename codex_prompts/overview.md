# Overview of Codex Prompts

This folder houses prompts tailored for OpenAI Codex and ChatGPT usage. They provide scaffolding, tooling, CI/CD, and onboarding instructions for new repositories, plus a codebase testing plan.

The core **Codex Prompt Suite** is split across four files:

1. `01_project_init_codex.md`
2. `02_tooling_and_quality_codex.md`
3. `03_ci_cd_codex.md`
4. `04_docs_and_onboarding_codex.md`

Run these prompts sequentially in a fresh ChatGPT session to scaffold and document a new project.
