    "instructions": "1. Review the current workflow, KPI metrics, and technology stack.\n1. List the top five accuracy or transparency risks and their root causes.\n1. For each risk, recommend one or two mitigations drawing on industry best practice (e.g., automated disbursements, real-time dashboards, milestone advances, blockchain audit trails).\n1. Prioritize mitigations using a RICE or effort-vs-impact matrix.\n1. Outline a 90\u2011day implementation roadmap with checkpoints and metrics.\n1. Use bullet lists and a text-based Gantt-style schedule.\n1. Ask clarifying questions if any workflow details are missing.",
