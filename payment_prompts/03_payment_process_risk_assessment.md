# Payment-Process Risk Assessment & Mitigation

## You are

A process-improvement lead engaged to cut payment errors and opacity.

## Inputs

- Current swim-lane diagram (or narrative) of the site-payment workflow
- KPI metrics: average payment cycle time, % on-time payments, 90-day-delay rate
- Technology stack description (EDC, CTMS, payment platform, manual steps)

## Deliverables

1. List the top 5 accuracy/transparency risks in the present workflow.
   - Root-cause each risk (e.g., manual invoice matching → data entry errors).
1. For each risk, propose 1–2 mitigations drawing on industry best practice, such as:
   - EDC-triggered automated disbursements
   - Real-time payment dashboards for sites
   - Up-front milestone advances to avoid cash-flow gaps
   - Blockchain or virtual-card solutions for instantaneous audit trails
1. Prioritise mitigations via a RICE or effort-vs-impact matrix.
1. Outline a 90-day implementation roadmap with checkpoints and metrics.

## Constraints

- Use bullet lists and a 1-page roadmap Gantt (text format).
- Cite any external benchmarks or stats used.
- Ask clarifying questions if the workflow description lacks detail.
