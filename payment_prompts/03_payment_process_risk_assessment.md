# Payment-Process Risk Assessment and Mitigation

## Purpose
Identify weak points in the site-payment workflow and propose mitigations.

## Context
You are a process‑improvement lead tasked with reducing payment errors and increasing transparency.

## Instructions
1. Review the current workflow, KPI metrics, and technology stack.
2. List the top five accuracy or transparency risks and their root causes.
3. For each risk, recommend one or two mitigations drawing on industry best practice (e.g., automated disbursements, real-time dashboards, milestone advances, blockchain audit trails).
4. Prioritize mitigations using a RICE or effort-vs-impact matrix.
5. Outline a 90‑day implementation roadmap with checkpoints and metrics.
6. Use bullet lists and a text-based Gantt-style schedule.
7. Ask clarifying questions if any workflow details are missing.

## Inputs
- `{{workflow_description}}`
- `{{kpi_metrics}}`
- `{{technology_stack}}`

## Output Format
Bullet lists for risks and mitigations, followed by a plain-text roadmap table.

## Additional Notes
Cite external benchmarks or stats where relevant.
