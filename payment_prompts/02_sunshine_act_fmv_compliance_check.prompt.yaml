      1. Load the CSV and normalize currency to USD using the provided FX rates.
      1. For each line item:
         - Determine if a single payment ≥ $13.46 or annual aggregate > $134.54.
         - Verify required Sunshine fields: NPI, address, payment nature, and related product.
         - Compare investigator fees to FMV benchmarks (±10 %).
      1. Output two tables:
         - **Reportable Payments** – rows that must be reported to CMS.
         - **Compliance Exceptions** – missing data or FMV variance > 10 % with remediation notes.
      1. Summarize lines reviewed, percent reportable, and percent exceptions.
      1. Ask questions if thresholds or tables seem outdated.

        Inputs:
        - `{{payment_ledger_csv}}` – raw payment ledger CSV
        - `{{fx_rates}}` – foreign-exchange rate table
        - `{{fmv_table}}` – fair market value reference table

      Output format:
      Two CSV-formatted tables followed by a short executive summary.

      Additional notes:
      Use clear column headers so the tables can be imported without modification.
