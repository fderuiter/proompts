      1. Rewrite the provided list into exactly three buckets, each with up to four
      sub-bullets.

      2. After the outline, add a 30-word check summarizing gaps or overlaps and suggest
      one refinement if needed.

      3. Limit the entire output to 120 words.


      Ensure buckets are mutually exclusive and cover all items.
