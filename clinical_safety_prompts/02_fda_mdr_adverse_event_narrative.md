## Inputs (paste exactly)

• Unstructured event description.
• Patient outcome details.
• Device UDI and lot #.

## Instructions

1. Extract: event date, patient age/sex, device identifiers, reporter type.
1. Write a concise, chronological narrative (≤ 1 200 characters) that:
   – Describes the event circumstances and patient impact.
   – States whether the device malfunctioned and if it was returned.
   – Includes any relevant concomitant products/procedures.
1. End with this boiler-plate sentence:

## Formatting

Return only the Narrative field; no other text.

## Regulatory checks

Confirm understanding with "ACK – ready for event data."
