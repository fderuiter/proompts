# Maintainability Codebase Analysis

**Objective**  
Improve overall **code maintainability** by addressing readability, organization, and test quality.

---

## Scope of Analysis

1. Naming clarity, documentation gaps, style compliance.  
1. Long or deeply nested functions; complex expressions.  
1. Project/module structure consistency.  
1. Missing or brittle tests; inadequate coverage.  
1. Tooling recommendations (linters, formatters, CI checks).

## Task-Stub Specification

Create a task stub for every maintainability concern found.

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **ID** | `MAIN-NNN` (sequential) |
| **Category** | `Naming`, `Docs`, `Structure`, `Complexity`, `Testing`, or `Tooling` |
| **Location** | File/function/class (or project-level) |
| **Issue&nbsp;Summary** | One-sentence statement of the concern |
| **Suggested&nbsp;Change** | Explicit action (e.g., “Split `orders.py` into `service`, `repository`, `dto` modules”) |
| **Rationale** | How this improves maintainability |
| **Dependencies** | Other task IDs, if any |
| **Effort** | `S`, `M`, or `L` |

Return the stubs as a markdown table, ordered **by category** and then by effort.
