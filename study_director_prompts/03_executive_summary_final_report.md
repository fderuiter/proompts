1. State the NOAEL and justify it with reference to dose‑response data.
1. Highlight deviations and explain how they were resolved.
1. Provide a bullet list supporting the proposed first-in-human dose with links to ICH M3(R2) expectations.
1. End with a four-item checklist the Study Director must sign.

## Inputs

- `{{report_sections}}` – draft CTD modules and tables.
