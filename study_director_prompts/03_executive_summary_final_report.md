Task: Create a two-page Executive Summary that:
  • Succinctly describes study design, methodology, and key findings.
  • States the NOAEL and its justification with reference to dose-response data.
  • Highlights any deviations and their resolved impact on data integrity.
  • Provides a bullet list of points supporting the proposed first-in-human (FIH) dose, linking to ICH M3(R2) expectations.
Constraints & style:
  • ≤800 words; clear, formal language suitable for FDA reviewers.
  • Follow CTD heading hierarchy (e.g., 4.2.3.1 Objectives…).
  • End with a 4-item checklist the Study Director must sign.
Plan the document internally; reveal only the finished summary.
