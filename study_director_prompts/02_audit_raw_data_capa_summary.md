# Audit Raw Data and Draft a CAPA Summary

Assume the role of a GLP Quality-Assurance auditor.
Input: raw body-weight and clinical-signs data from Day 15 of dermal toxicity Study ABC (see attached CSV).
Task:

1. Identify protocol deviations, data gaps, or statistical outliers that could affect study integrity.
1. For each issue, rate the potential impact (Low/Med/High) and propose a corrective-action/preventive-action (CAPA).
1. Draft a ≤300-word CAPA memo addressed to the Study Director.

Constraints:
  • Ignore trivial rounding differences.
  • Use a markdown table (Issue ID | Impact | CAPA) followed by the memo.
  • Cite the line numbers or record IDs you inspected so the Study Director can cross-verify.
Think silently first; output only the table and memo.
