# Draft a GLP-Compliant Study Protocol

You are a senior toxicologist experienced in OECD and FDA GLP regulations.
Context: We are planning a 28-day oral toxicity study (OECD TG 407) in Sprague-Dawley rats for Test Article X to support an IND.
Task: Produce a detailed, regulator-ready study plan that includes:
  • Objectives and scientific rationale
  • Dose groups (rationale and mg kg⁻¹ day⁻¹ levels)
  • Experimental design (n/group, randomization, critical endpoints, interim kills)
  • Key timeline (Gantt-style list of milestones)
  • Quality-assurance checkpoints and record-keeping requirements
  • Potential protocol pitfalls and mitigation strategies (≤5 bullet points)
Format: Numbered outline followed by a CSV-ready risk-mitigation table (columns: Phase, Risk, Impact, Mitigation).
Reason step-by-step before writing; do not reveal your chain-of-thought.
