# Draft a GLP-Compliant Study Protocol

## Purpose
Produce a detailed, regulator-ready plan for a 28-day oral toxicity study in rats.

## Context
You are a senior toxicologist experienced in OECD and FDA GLP regulations. The study will follow OECD TG 407 to support an IND for Test Article X.

## Instructions
1. Summarize objectives and scientific rationale.
2. Specify dose groups with rationale and mg kg⁻¹ day⁻¹ levels.
3. Outline experimental design including n/group, randomization, critical endpoints, and interim kills.
4. Provide a Gantt-style timeline of key milestones.
5. Describe quality-assurance checkpoints and record-keeping requirements.
6. List potential protocol pitfalls and mitigation strategies (≤5 bullet points).
7. Present a numbered outline followed by a CSV-ready risk-mitigation table with columns: Phase, Risk, Impact, Mitigation.
8. Reason internally before writing; do not reveal your chain of thought.

## Inputs
None

## Output Format
Numbered outline plus CSV-ready risk-mitigation table.

## Additional Notes
