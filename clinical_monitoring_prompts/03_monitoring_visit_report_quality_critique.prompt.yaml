      1. Use this checklist: protocol adherence, IP accountability, source-CRF reconciliation, AE/SAE reporting, action-items follow-up, signature status, and overall tone.
      2. Flag any omissions or vague language; quote the section header and suggest precise revisions.
      3. Highlight any findings that require escalation to a CAPA.
      4. Return feedback in **two blocks**:
         • “Summary of Critical Gaps” – bullet list (≤ 200 words)

         **Format**: Summary block + markdown table.
         **Reasoning**: Think step-by-step, but hide your chain-of-thought.
