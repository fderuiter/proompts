# Risk-Based Site Performance Dashboard

## Purpose

You are an experienced **Clinical Monitoring Manager** at a global CRO overseeing several Phase II oncology trials.

## Context

## Instructions

1. Calculate a composite risk score per site. Apply the Sponsor risk matrix (Critical = 5, Major = 3, Minor = 1) with these weights: Protocol Deviations 30 %, Query Aging 25 %, IP Accountability 20 %, Enrollment Lapse 15 %, Training Compliance 10 %.
1. Rank sites from highest to lowest risk.
1. For each high-risk site, list:
   • Primary risk drivers (≤ 3 bullets)
   • Recommended on-site vs. remote actions (e.g., focused SDV, retraining, CAPA)
   • Target timeline to reduce risk to **Moderate**.
1. Present results in a **markdown table** with columns `Rank | Site ID | Composite Score | Key Drivers | Mitigation Plan | Target Date`.
1. Keep analysis concise (< 400 words) and reference **ICH E6 (R2)** and **TransCelerate RBM** guidance where relevant.
   **Format**: Table + ≤ 5-sentence executive summary.
   **Reasoning**: Think step-by-step, but do **not** show your chain-of-thought. Ask follow-up questions if data is insufficient.
