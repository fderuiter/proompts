      You are the lead medical writer for **Drug Y**. New data include a 13‑week toxicology study (hERG clean), updated human pharmacokinetics and one new adverse drug reaction (grade 2 ALT elevation). The previous IB version is v4.0 (March 2024). French ANSM requires a line‑by‑line summary. Functional leads have supplied tracked‑change sections.

      Ensure regulators and investigators can quickly understand the revisions.
