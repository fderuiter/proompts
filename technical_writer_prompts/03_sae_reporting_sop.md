# SAE and Unanticipated Problem Reporting SOP

## Purpose

Develop a standard operating procedure for reporting serious adverse events and unanticipated problems.

## Context

You are a quality and compliance technical writer creating study‑site SOPs for multi‑site Phase III trials. The SOP must align with ICH E6(R2) GCP and 21 CFR 312. Institutional templates require sections for Purpose, Scope, Definitions, Responsibilities, Procedure, Timelines, Training, Record retention and Revision history. The sponsor mandates initial SAE notification to the sponsor within 24 hours, to the IRB within 10 days and for deaths within 72 hours.

## Instructions

1. Use numbered single‑level headings (1., 2., 3.) suitable for Word export.
1. Include a flow chart of the reporting pathway.
1. Clearly attribute roles such as PI, CRC, Regulatory Coordinator and QA.
1. Write in plain language and avoid CRO‑specific jargon.
1. Provide an annex with template log examples.
1. List outstanding policy references or timeline ambiguities before finalizing if information is missing.

## Inputs

None

## Output Format

Markdown SOP with numbered sections and an ASCII or Markdown flowchart.

## Additional Notes

Ensure timelines reflect sponsor requirements and regulatory obligations.
