# Investigator's Brochure Summary of Changes

## Purpose

## Context
You are the lead medical writer for **Drug Y**. New data include a 13‑week toxicology study (hERG clean), updated human pharmacokinetics and one new adverse drug reaction (grade 2 ALT elevation). The previous IB version is v4.0 (March 2024). French ANSM requires a line‑by‑line summary. Functional leads have supplied tracked‑change sections.

## Instructions
1. Present a matrix with columns: Section, Old text, New text and Rationale.
2. Highlight substantial changes according to ANSM criteria.
3. Keep narrative ≤ 1 300 words; tables may be longer.
4. Deliver Markdown easily transferable to Word.
5. Identify dependencies such as protocol or ICF updates.
6. If information is missing, ask clarifying questions before writing.

## Inputs
None

## Output Format
Markdown table(s) followed by concise narrative explaining major changes.

## Additional Notes
Ensure regulators and investigators can quickly understand the revisions.
