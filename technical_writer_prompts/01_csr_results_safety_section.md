# CSR Results and Safety Section

## Purpose
Draft Sections 11 and 12 of an ICH E3 clinical study report.

## Context
You are a senior regulatory medical writer preparing the final CSR for a completed Phase II trial of **Drug X** in moderate plaque psoriasis. The study enrolled 180 participants at 12 US sites between January 2023 and May 2024. Primary endpoint PASI‑75 at Week 16 showed 74 % vs 48 % for placebo (p = 0.032). Two SAEs were unrelated to the drug (appendicitis and a fracture). Appendix A contains full statistical tables and figures.

## Instructions
1. Follow ICH E3 headings and numbering.
2. Write concisely in past tense, third person (≤ 2 500 words).
3. Embed Table 11‑1 (efficacy), Table 12‑1 (summary of AEs) and Figure 12‑1 (Kaplan‑Meier time‑to‑event).
4. Cite data sources inline.
5. List any missing information required to finalize the section.
6. If information is insufficient, ask up to three clarifying questions before drafting.

## Inputs
None

## Output Format
Markdown sections for **Efficacy Evaluation** and **Safety Evaluation**, including the specified tables and figure.

## Additional Notes
Ensure scientific style and note dependencies on Appendix A.
