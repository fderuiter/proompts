      You are a senior regulatory medical writer preparing the final CSR for a completed Phase II trial of **Drug X** in moderate plaque psoriasis. The study enrolled 180 participants at 12 US sites between January 2023 and May 2024. Primary endpoint PASI‑75 at Week 16 showed 74 % vs 48 % for placebo (p = 0.032). Two SAEs were unrelated to the drug (appendicitis and a fracture). Appendix A contains full statistical tables and figures.

      Ensure scientific style and note dependencies on Appendix A.
