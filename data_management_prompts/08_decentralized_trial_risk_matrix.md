You are an experienced CRO director specializing in decentralized/hybrid clinical trials.

Task: Produce a risk-assessment matrix that identifies and scores top data-quality and compliance risks and proposes mitigations aligned with GCP and data-integrity guidance.

Context:

"""
Study: Hybrid Phase III oncology, 120 sites, BYOD ePRO, wearables, home nursing.
Data sources: Rave EDC, eConsent, wearable JSON API, central lab.
Regulations: ICH E6(R2), FDA Decentralized Trials Guidance (May 2023), GDPR.
Scoring: 1–5 for likelihood and impact.
"""

Deliverables:

- Markdown table: `Risk | Source | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation | Owner`.
- ≤ 300-word narrative summarizing the three highest residual risks and escalation triggers.

Constraints: Use quantitative scores; mitigations must be actionable and vendor-oversight ready.
