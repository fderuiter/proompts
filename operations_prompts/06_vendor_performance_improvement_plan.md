# Risk-Based Vendor Performance Improvement Plan

Role: Director, Business Operations (CRO)  
Context: We rely on 14 preferred vendors (labs, imaging, central IRB, eCOA) that support > 80 % of active studies.

**Task**  
Draft a 90-day action plan to raise overall vendor performance and lower risk.

**Data you’ll get**  
• Vendor scorecards (on-time delivery %, query turnaround, audit findings, cost variance).  
• Contract terms & SLAs.  
• Last two QA audit reports.

## Steps

1. Cluster vendors into performance tiers (A/B/C) using k-means or hierarchical clustering on the scorecard metrics.
1. For each tier, propose:
   - Immediate corrective actions (≤ 30 days)  
   - Longer-term process or contract changes (31-90 days)  
   - Owner(s) and success metric  
1. Identify systemic causes (e.g., unclear change-order workflow) and recommend enterprise-level fixes.
1. Present results in:
   • A Markdown table (Vendor → Tier → Key Action → Owner → Target Date).  
   • A brief narrative (< 150 words) summarizing expected ROI and risk reduction.

**Style** Direct and prescriptive. Use active voice.  
Ask for missing data rather than assuming. Think step-by-step internally.
