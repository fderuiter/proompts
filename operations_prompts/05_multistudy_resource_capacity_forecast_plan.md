# Multistudy Resource & Capacity Forecast Plan

Act as a senior CRO resource-planning consultant.

## Context

Over the next 9 months we expect 12 new Phase II/III trials. Each requires different FTE mixes (project management, data management, site monitoring) and technology costs.

## Task

1. Show a step-by-step approach (with formulas) for forecasting head-count and spend using historical utilization data.
1. Provide a sample RACI matrix for cross-functional collaboration (Ops, Finance, HR, IT).
1. Suggest three automation opportunities to streamline capacity planning.

### Constraints

Use best-practice workflow-optimization principles and emphasize data-driven decision-making.

### Output Format

- Section A: numbered methodology steps (max 7).
- Section B: Markdown RACI table.
- Section C: bullet list of automation ideas (â‰¤25 words each).

## Why It Matters

Workflow optimization, resource allocation and cross-department collaboration are core duties for Business Operations Specialists.
