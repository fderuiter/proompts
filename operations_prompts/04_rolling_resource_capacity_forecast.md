## Instructions

2. Identify capacity gaps or surpluses greater than ±10 %.
3. Recommend hiring, cross-training or contractor actions to close gaps.
4. Provide a summary table with projected demand, supply and variance, a risk list for functions over 120 % or under 80 % utilization, and a rationale under 200 words.

## Inputs

- `{{project_list}}` – project schedules and scope.
- `{{time_tracking_csv}}` – historical hours.
- `{{headcount}}` – approved FTEs and open requisitions.

## Output Format
