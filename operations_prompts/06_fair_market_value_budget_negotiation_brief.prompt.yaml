    content: 'You are an experienced CRO contract-budget negotiator. The sponsor wants
      a single rate card across diverse sites, while our sites require locality adjustments.


      1. Summarize typical FMV pain points for sponsors versus sites.

      2. Propose a tiered, region-sensitive compensation model and a transparent calculation
      template.

      3. Provide three evidence-based talking points on how flexible FMV improves
      start-up speed and overall cost control.


      Maintain a professional tone and cite peer-reviewed or industry sources where
      possible. FMV transparency helps balance sustainability and cost efficiency.'
