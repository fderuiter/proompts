# Fair-Market-Value Budget Negotiation Brief

You are an experienced CRO contract-budget negotiator.

## Context

Weâ€™re entering FMV talks with a top-10 pharma sponsor across diverse global sites (urban U.S., EU, APAC). The sponsor wants a one-size-fits-all rate card; our sites need locality adjustments to stay sustainable.

## Task

1. Draft a two-page briefing that:
   - summarizes common FMV pain points for sponsors vs. sites,
   - proposes a tiered, region-sensitive compensation model, and
   - outlines a transparent calculation template we can share.
1. Include three evidence-based talking points on how flexible FMV improves study start-up speed and overall cost control.

### Constraints

Professional tone, bullet style, cite peer-reviewed or industry sources where possible.

### Output Format

Structured Markdown with H2 headings and nested bullets.

## Why It Matters

Balancing transparent FMV with cost-efficiency is a growing priority highlighted in industry analyses.
