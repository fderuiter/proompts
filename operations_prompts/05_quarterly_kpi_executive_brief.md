# Quarterly CRO KPI Executive Brief

Act as the Business Operations lead preparing the Q3 Executive Brief for our CRO.

**Goal**  
Transform raw operational data into a C-suite-ready dashboard narrative that instantly signals performance, risks, and required decisions.

**Inputs available**  
• Operational dataset (Redshift): study start-up cycle time, enrollment rate, CRF completion lag, protocol deviations, revenue vs. forecast, EBITDA, employee turnover.  
• Internal KPI definitions & thresholds (Excel).  
• Commentary from functional heads (Word docs).

**Deliverables**  
A. One-page written narrative that:  
   ▸ Highlights 3 KPIs above target, 3 below target, root-cause hypotheses, and one actionable decision for each lagging KPI.  
   ▸ Summarizes overall financial health in ≤ 75 words.  
B. PowerPoint outline (slide titles + bullet points) for a 6-slide deck.  
C. Suggested data-viz styles (e.g., bullet chart, sparkline) for each KPI.

**Constraints** Avoid jargon; assume audience is time-pressed. Place any numbers in parentheses after the KPI name.  
Invite follow-up questions if data anomalies appear. Use first-person plural (“we”, “our”).  
Reason out loud internally before producing the final answer (but do not show that chain of thought).
