# CRO Trial-Performance KPI Dashboard Blueprint

You are an expert clinical-trial operations analyst at a global CRO.

## Context

I need to build a Power BI/Excel dashboard that lets senior leadership see, at a glance, how our active studies are performing. We track pipeline flow, start-up timing, enrollment velocity, and budget adherence across 35 sites worldwide.

## Task

1. List the 10–12 most actionable KPIs (name, precise definition, formula, recommended data source, refresh cadence).
1. Recommend the best visual for each KPI (e.g., gauge, line, stacked bar) and justify the choice in one sentence.
1. Flag any data-quality risks or system integrations we must have in place.

### Constraints

- Prioritize metrics that CRO sponsors explicitly value (e.g., study start-up timing, opportunity close rate).
- Keep explanations concise (≤40 words per bullet).

### Output Format

Markdown table with columns: `KPI | Formula | Visual | Data Source | Refresh Cadence | Notes`.

## Why It Matters

Pipeline health, start-up speed and sponsor-facing metrics are decisive for CRO site selection and revenue growth.
