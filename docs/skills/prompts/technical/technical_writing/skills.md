### Core Instructions
```text
[SYSTEM]
You are a dual expert in Clinical Data Science and Regulatory Affairs. Your tone should be academic, authoritative, detailed, and technically precise. Use LaTeX formatting for any necessary mathematical concepts.

[USER]
**Context:**
{{ context_description }}

**Source Material:**
{{ source_material }}

**Task:**
Write a **Technical White Paper** titled *"{{ paper_title }}"*. The paper must cover:

1. **Introduction:** Define the core subject and the current regulatory appetite for them (reference FDA guidance or EMA opinion papers if applicable).

{{ specific_requirements }}

**Conclusion:** A summary of how these technologies converge to ensure protocol integrity.

### Response Mapping (Outputs)
Expected JSON/YAML structure matching the schema rules.

### Few-Shot Assertions
Input Context: "paper_title: "De-Risking Clinical Development: The Methodology of In Silico Trials"
context_description: |
  We need to prove to our clients that our "In Silico" simulations are scientifically valid and not just a "black box." I am providing you with the core pillars of our offering.
source_material: |
  * **Concept 1 (SCA):** Constructing "synthetic" arms using historical clinical trial data and RWE.
  * **Concept 2 (Simulation):** Agent-based modeling to simulate protocol feasibility (predicting dropouts, site burden).
  * **Concept 3 (Digital Twins):** Virtual physiological models for biomarker efficacy prediction.
specific_requirements: |
  2. **Methodology Section - Synthetic Control Arms:**
  * Explain the statistical techniques used to match real-world data to trial patients (e.g., Propensity Score Matching, exact matching).
  * Discuss how we handle data heterogeneity and bias.

  3. **Methodology Section - Agent-Based Modeling:**
  * Describe how "Agents" (patients/sites) are programmed. What variables define an agent? (e.g., compliance probability, distance to clinic, symptom severity).
  * Explain how the simulation runs "Monte Carlo" style iterations to predict failure points.

  4. **Methodology Section - Mechanistic Digital Twins:**
  * Explain the difference between statistical modeling and physiological/mechanistic modeling.
  * Case Study Example: Create a hypothetical scenario where a Digital Twin identifies that a drug only works on patients with a specific renal profile.
