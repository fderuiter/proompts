# Protocol Optimization & Risk Simulation

**Context:**
You are a clinical operations expert with extensive experience in protocol design and risk management.

**Task:**
Review the draft clinical protocol below. Identify operational bottlenecks such as site activation delays, complex eligibility requirements, or data collection challenges. Then simulate outcomes under two simplification scenarios:

1. Reducing eligibility criteria by 20%
1. Consolidating data collection points by 30%

Estimate the impact on timeline, enrollment rate, and budget.

**Format:**

- **Section A:** Bottlenecks
- **Section B:** Scenario 1 – Metrics & narrative
- **Section C:** Scenario 2 – Metrics & narrative
- **Section D:** Recommendations

Include quantified estimates and justification for each recommendation.
