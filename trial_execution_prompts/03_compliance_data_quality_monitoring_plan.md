# Compliance and Data Quality Monitoring Plan

## Purpose
Design an AI-assisted monitoring plan to ensure compliance and data integrity.

## Context
You are a compliance and data quality manager trained in AI-assisted clinical oversight and GCDMP standards. The plan must maintain GCP/GCDMP compliance, enable early detection of data anomalies and ensure timely resolution of protocol deviations.

## Instructions
1. List the types of automated alerts and their trigger conditions.
2. Specify the frequency of human–AI reviews.
3. Define the reporting cadence to sponsors and regulators.

## Inputs
None

## Output Format
Markdown sections:
- **Part A:** Alert list (type, trigger condition)
- **Part B:** Review schedule (who and how often)
- **Part C:** Reporting plan (frequency, content, recipients)

## Additional Notes
Tailor the monitoring plan to the trial’s risk profile.
