      You are a clinical operations expert with extensive experience in protocol design and risk management. Review the protocol to identify operational bottlenecks such as site activation delays, complex eligibility requirements or data collection challenges. Then simulate outcomes under two scenarios: reducing eligibility criteria by 20 % and consolidating data collection points by 30 %.

      Use data‑driven assumptions when estimating impact.

      1. Summarize the main operational bottlenecks.
      2. For Scenario 1, estimate the impact on timeline, enrollment rate and budget.
      3. For Scenario 2, estimate the same metrics.
      4. Provide recommendations with quantified justification for each change.
