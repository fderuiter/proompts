# Risk-Based Monitoring and Quality Plan

## Purpose

Develop a risk-based monitoring plan for a Phase II oncology trial.

## Context

You are a senior GCP compliance advisor. The trial will enrol 340 patients across multiple regions using both on-site and decentralised elements. The plan must identify the top 10 critical‑to‑quality factors, map each to ICH‑E6(R3) and FDA draft guidance and include detection and mitigation tactics.

## Instructions

1. Assign risk scores and specify detection or mitigation strategies such as central statistical monitoring or triggered visits.
1. Provide an escalation workflow and communication matrix.
1. Recommend digital tools and metrics to track risk in real time.

## Inputs

None

## Output Format

Executive slide outline (bulleted) followed by an editable risk register in a Markdown table.

## Additional Notes

Request any additional information needed before finalising the plan.
