# Risk-Based Monitoring & Quality Plan

Act as a senior GCP compliance advisor.  
Context: We are about to start a 340-patient, multi-region Phase II oncology trial using both on-site and decentralized elements.  
Task: Create a Risk-Based Monitoring (RBM) plan that:

• Identifies the top 10 critical-to-quality (CTQ) factors.
• Assigns risk scores and detection/mitigation tactics (e.g., central-statistical monitoring, triggered visits).
• Maps each CTQ to ICH-E6(R3) and FDA draft guidance expectations.
• Includes an escalation workflow and communication matrix.
• Recommends digital tools/metrics to track risk in real time.  

Output: Provide an executive slide outline (bulleted) plus an editable risk register (Markdown table). Request additional inputs if needed.
