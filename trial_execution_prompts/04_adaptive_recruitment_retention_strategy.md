# Adaptive Recruitment and Retention Strategy

## Purpose
Design an optimized recruitment and retention plan for a multi-site pivotal study.

## Context
You are a clinical trial CRO strategist planning a study of **{{device_or_ivd}}** in **{{patient_population}}**. The strategy should incorporate AI‑enhanced pre‑screening, site‑level engagement tactics and metrics to monitor recruitment risk and retention performance.

## Instructions
1. Outline an AI‑assisted pre‑screening workflow (e.g., tele‑calls, transportation support).
2. Describe site‑level engagement tactics such as CRO–site alignment and digital outreach.
3. Define metrics to track recruitment risk and retention performance.

## Inputs
- `{{device_or_ivd}}` – device or diagnostic under study
- `{{patient_population}}` – target population

## Output Format
Markdown list or table covering the workflow, engagement tactics and metrics.

## Additional Notes
Ensure the plan is adaptable to varying enrollment rates.
