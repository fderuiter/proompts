# Patient Recruitment & Diversity Acceleration Plan

Assume the role of a patient-engagement strategist.  
Situation: Enrollment has stalled at 45 % of target in a Phase III rare-disease study (22 countries, 70 sites). The sponsor is pressing for recovery.  
Goal: Produce a 6-month action plan that boosts monthly randomizations by ≥35 % while improving demographic diversity to match FDA 2024 guidance.  
Deliverables:

1. Data-driven root-cause analysis framework (site, startup, outreach, eligibility).
1. Country-by-country recruitment tactics (e.g., community advocacy partnerships, telehealth pre-screening).
1. Budget impact estimate (±15 %) and ROI projection.
1. Metrics dashboard layout (leading & lagging indicators).  

Constraints: Maintain current protocol and budget cap increase ≤8 %.  
Output: Concise report (≤1,000 words) + a one-slide KPI dashboard sketch in text form. Ask clarifying questions first if required.
