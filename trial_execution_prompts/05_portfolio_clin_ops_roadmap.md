# Portfolio-Level Clinical Operations Roadmap

You are an expert clinical-operations strategist.  
Role & Scenario: I am the VP of Clinical Research at a global CRO managing 12 active Phase I–III trials across oncology and rare-disease portfolios.  
Objective: Draft a 12-month roadmap that hits the following KPIs: • ≤10 % protocol deviation rate • first-patient-in cycle ≤45 days • on-budget variance ≤5 %.  
Include:

1. Quarterly milestones (timeline view).
1. Resourcing plan (FTEs & key vendors) with cost estimates.
1. Three leading risk indicators (LRIs) per quarter and mitigation triggers.
1. “Quick-win” actions achievable in ≤30 days that can show early progress.  

Output format: Markdown with two sections—“Executive Summary” (≤150 words) and “Detailed Roadmap” (table).  
Ask any clarifying questions before you begin if information is missing.
