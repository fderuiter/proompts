         - `{{LANGUAGES/FRAMEWORKS}}`
         - `{{BUSINESS_GOAL}}`
      1. Direct the assistant to map the structure, user journeys, interfaces, data fixtures, non-functional requirements, edge cases, environment details, test plan skeleton, and coverage gaps.
      1. Instruct it to return a markdown report with numbered sections covering each topic.
      1. Tell the assistant to ask clarifying questions first if information is missing.
      Inputs:
      - `{{PROJECT_NAME}}` – project identifier
      - `{{LANGUAGES/FRAMEWORKS}}` – primary tech stack
      - `{{BUSINESS_GOAL}}` – high-level goal of the system
      Output format:
      Markdown report with sections:

      1. Repository Overview
