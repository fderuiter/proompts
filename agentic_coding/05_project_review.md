# Project Review Guidelines

Before considering your work complete:

- [ ] **Run formatter:** Use `dotnet format` or equivalent tool.
- [ ] **Execute tests** with `dotnet test` and fix any failures.
- [ ] **Resolve warnings** identified by the compiler or static analysis tools.
- [ ] **Code review** by running `git diff --name-only main` and verifying all changes.
- [ ] Verify the **to-do list** ensuring all tasks are completed.
- [ ] Cross-reference the current state of the project with details in `memory.md`.
- [ ] Update development guidelines with insights from the completed project.
