      This plan guides developers in structuring modules, selecting libraries, and mitigating risks.

      Revise the plan iteratively until all risks are addressed.

      1. Define modules, services, and overall architecture.
      1. List the libraries, frameworks, and tools to use.
      1. Describe all required data models with fields and constraints.
      1. Specify business logic and rules in clear terms.
      1. Identify dependencies, risks, and proposed solutions.
      1. Outline step-by-step implementation for each feature or service.

         Iterate the plan at least three times for robustness.
      Inputs:
      - `{{architecture_overview}}` – proposed system structure
      - `{{technology_choices}}` – libraries and frameworks
      - `{{data_models}}` – entities and relationships
      Output format:
      Markdown sections for Architecture Breakdown, Libraries and Tools, Data Models & Specifications, Business Logic & Rules, Dependencies & Risk Analysis, and Implementation Steps.
