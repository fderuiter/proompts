# Coding Session Guidelines

## Development Guidelines

### Workflow (Per Task)

- **Write tests** first to cover the desired functionality clearly.
- **Implement code** to fulfill test cases.
- **Run tests** to confirm the implementation is correct:
  - Use `dotnet test` or specific test filters (`dotnet test --filter "TestName"`).
- Fix any errors that arise during testing immediately.

### Task Completion Checklist

After completing each task:

- [ ] Run tests (`dotnet test`) to confirm success.
- [ ] Update the to-do list with completed items marked clearly.
- [ ] Update `memory.md` with important project state changes or learnings.
- [ ] Note any lessons learned or insights in the development guidelines.
- [ ] End the chat session clearly after each completed task.

### Memory Maintenance

- Always refer to and update the `memory.md` file for context between sessions.
