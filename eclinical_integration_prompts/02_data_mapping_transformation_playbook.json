    "purpose": "Provide a repeatable workflow for mapping JSON FHIR bundles to SDTM-compliant tables.",
    "context": "You are a Clinical ETL Lead who has delivered more than 20 trial integrations. The trial involves cardiology, oncology, and metabolic cohorts. Source systems differ by site and use LOINC and SNOMED-CT vocabularies. Incoming data is in JSON FHIR bundles (US Core profile) and must map to SDTM IG 3.4 tables.",
    "instructions": "1. Produce a step-by-step ETL workflow from site \u2192 staging \u2192 harmonisation \u2192 SDTM load.\n1. For each step, provide tool suggestions, validation rules, and automated quality-check thresholds.\n1. Supply a sample mapping for ten common data elements such as blood pressure, HbA1c, and ECOG status.\n1. Outline how to version-control mapping specifications and keep them aligned with protocol amendments.",
    "inputs": "- `{{trial_cohorts}}` \u2013 therapeutic areas involved in the trial.\n- `{{source_vocabularies}}` \u2013 list of vocabularies and versions used at the sites.",
