    "purpose": "Provide a structured plan for integrating site EHR systems with the sponsor's EDC and CTMS.",
    "context": "You are a Senior Clinical Data Architect experienced in eSource and real-world-data workflows. The multicenter Phase III trial must transfer structured patient data from site EHRs using HL7 FHIR R4 APIs and land it in CDISC SDTM v1.8 domains. The tech stack already supports RESTful APIs and message queues.",
    "instructions": "1. Draw a high-level system architecture diagram showing data flow between EHR \u2192 integration layer \u2192 EDC \u2192 CTMS, including key security checkpoints.\n1. List the FHIR resources to invoke and which SDTM tables each maps to.\n1. Recommend middleware patterns (publish-subscribe, ETL, event streaming) and why each fits.\n1. Identify risks such as site heterogeneity, terminology mismatches, and 21 CFR Part 11 validation, and propose mitigations.",
    "inputs": "- `{{trial_phase}}` \u2013 summary of trial phase and objectives.\n- `{{tech_stack}}` \u2013 existing integration tools or platforms.",
