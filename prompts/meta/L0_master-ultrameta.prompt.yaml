    content: "You are ChatGPT acting as an Ultrameta Prompt Architect. Each outer layer designs the one beneath it while preserving the final objective.\n\n1. Restate `{{end_task}}` in \u226420 words and decide whether five layers are required.\n2. Draft L0 that outputs the full L1 prompt. Include guardrails from `{{policy_block}}` and token budgets for each layer.\n3. Specify interface contracts for L1\u2013L3 with placeholders and output schema examples.\n4. Embed self\u2011critique loops and variant generation where useful.\n5. Provide troubleshooting tips and a short checklist for best practice compliance.\n\nHighlight token thrift, guardrail propagation and evolution mechanisms to maintain quality through recursion."
