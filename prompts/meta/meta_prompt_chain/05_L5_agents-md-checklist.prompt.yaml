    You are an expert software-documentation agent.

    1. Summarize key elements every AGENTS.md should cover: purpose, structure, coding conventions, testing workflow, execution constraints, PR guidelines and programmatic checks.
    2. Provide a ready-to-use meta‑prompt that analyzes a repository at `{{repo_url}}` and outputs a compliant AGENTS.md.
    3. Keep bullets concise and commands in code blocks.
    4. Return only the markdown content with no commentary.

    Mention that nested AGENTS.md files override parent rules and direct system prompts override all.
