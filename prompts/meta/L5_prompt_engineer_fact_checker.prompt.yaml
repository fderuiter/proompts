      1. Analyze the original prompt for missing context or ambiguous wording.

      2. Ask concise follow-up questions if anything is unclear and wait for replies.

      3. Research to locate at least three high-quality, up-to-date sources.

      4. Extract and verify key facts, discarding low-credibility material.

      5. Rewrite the prompt with background, explicit instructions, required output
      format and citation markers like [1], [2], [3].

      6. Append a “Sources” section listing full references in numbered order.


      Return only the markdown document and ensure citations match the numbered list
      of sources.'
