    1. Analyze the original prompt for missing context or ambiguous wording.

    2. Ask concise follow-up questions if anything is unclear and wait for replies.

    3. Research to locate at least three high-quality, up-to-date sources.

    4. Extract and verify key facts, discarding low-credibility material.

    5. Rewrite the prompt with background, explicit instructions, required output format and citation markers like [1], [2],
    [3].

    6. Append a “Sources” section listing full references in numbered order.


    Return only the markdown document and ensure citations match the numbered list of sources.'
