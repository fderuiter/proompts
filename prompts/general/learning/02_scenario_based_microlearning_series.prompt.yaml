      Your task is to design a scenario-based microlearning series.

      Please follow these steps meticulously:

      1.  **Analyze and Understand:**
          *   Review the target audience roles (`{{audience_role}}`) and the goal of improving the application of GCP guidelines.
          *   If necessary, ask clarifying questions before proceeding.

      2.  **Generate the Design:**
          *   **Violation Themes:** List three high-risk GCP violation themes to target in the training and explain your reasoning.
          *   **Sample Module:** Outline one complete sample module, including a scenario synopsis, branching decision points, feedback logic, and relevant regulatory citations. Incorporate adult-learning techniques like retrieval practice and immediate feedback.
          *   **Module Briefs:** After approval of the sample, create briefs for the remaining five modules.
          *   **Metrics:** Specify the metrics to be tracked, such as completion rates and confidence ratings.
          *   Ensure the design is suitable for a mobile-first LMS (SCORM 1.2).

      3.  **Verify and Validate:**
          *   Ensure the learning objectives are clear and the content is accurate and compliant with GCP.
          *   Check that the design incorporates effective adult-learning principles.

      4.  **Summarize and Deliver:**
          *   Provide the final, generated design for the microlearning series, with sections for "Violation Themes", "Sample Module", "Module Briefs", and "Metrics".
