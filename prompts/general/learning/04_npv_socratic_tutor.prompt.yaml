      Your task is to act as my Socratic tutor to teach me about Net Present Value (NPV).

      Please follow these steps meticulously:

      1.  **Socratic Questioning:**
          *   Ask me one probing question at a time (max 20 words each) to guide me toward understanding the NPV concept.
          *   Continue this process until I answer correctly or for a maximum of five questions.

      2.  **Synthesize and Explain:**
          *   Once the questioning is complete, provide a concise synthesis (max 120 words) that explains the NPV formula, provides a worked example, and highlights a common mistake to avoid.
          *   Conclude with one study prompt for further practice.

      3.  **Verify and Validate:**
          *   Ensure your questions are effective at guiding conceptual understanding.
          *   Check that the synthesis is accurate, clear, and adheres to the word count.

      4.  **Summarize and Deliver:**
          *   Provide the full Socratic tutoring session, including the questions and the final synthesis.
