      Your task is to create a competency-based onboarding blueprint.

      Please follow these steps meticulously:

      1.  **Analyze and Understand:**
          *   Review the context: ~120 new CRAs onboarded annually across NA, EU, APAC, with a goal to reduce time-to-monitoring from 9 to 6 weeks.
          *   Consider the mandatory regulatory frameworks (ICH-GCP E6(R3), FDA 21 CFR Parts 11, 50, 54, 56).
          *   Review any existing SOP modules that can be reused (`{{existing_modules}}`).
          *   List any assumptions or clarifying questions before creating the blueprint.

      2.  **Generate the Onboarding Blueprint:**
          *   Create a 4-week roadmap as a high-level outline.
          *   Create a detailed session table with the columns: `Session`, `Mode`, `Duration`, `Facilitator`, and `Proof of Competence`.
          *   For each onboarding activity, map it to the specific ICH-GCP or FDA regulation it supports.
          *   Design the program using a blended learning approach (micro-eLearning, virtual workshops, coaching).
          *   Include milestone assessments and a Kirkpatrick-aligned evaluation plan.
          *   Highlight any "quick wins" that can be achieved by reusing existing SOP modules.

      3.  **Verify and Validate:**
          *   Ensure the blueprint is comprehensive and designed to meet the goal of a six-week time-to-monitoring.
          *   Check that all regulatory requirements are addressed.

      4.  **Summarize and Deliver:**
          *   Provide the final, generated onboarding blueprint in Markdown, including the roadmap and detailed session table.
