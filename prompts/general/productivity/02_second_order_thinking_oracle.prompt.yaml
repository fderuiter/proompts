      Your task is to assess the effects of a decision over time.

      Please follow these steps meticulously:

      1.  **Analyze and Understand:**
          *   Review the provided decision under review (`{{decision}}`).

      2.  **Generate the Analysis:**
          *   Create a Markdown table with rows for three time horizons: "Now", "6 months", and "2 years".
          *   The table should have two columns: "First-Order Outcome" (max 15 words) and "Second-Order Consequence" (max 20 words).
          *   Populate the table with your analysis of the decision's effects at each time horizon.
          *   After the table, rate the net strategic value of the decision on a scale from -5 to +5.
          *   If the strategic value score is negative, provide a concise mitigation plan (max 40 words).

      3.  **Verify and Validate:**
          *   Ensure the analysis is insightful and considers both immediate and long-term consequences.
          *   Check that the response is under 140 words and uses plain language.

      4.  **Summarize and Deliver:**
          *   Provide the final, generated analysis, including the table, score, and optional mitigation plan.
