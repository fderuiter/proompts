      Your task is to create a Hero's Journey storyboard.

      Please follow these steps meticulously:

      1.  **Analyze and Understand:**
          *   Review the provided product or service (`{{product}}`).
          *   Adopt a friendly tone, with a kid-friendly tone being optional.

      2.  **Generate the Storyboard:**
          *   Write eight one-sentence "beats" that follow the Hero's Journey structure, from "Ordinary World" to "Return with Elixir".
          *   **Bold** each beat's title.
          *   After the eight beats, provide a brand takeaway (max 25 words) and one clear call to action.

      3.  **Verify and Validate:**
          *   Ensure the narrative follows the Hero's Journey structure and is no more than 140 words in total.
          *   Check that all formatting requirements (bolding, etc.) are met.

      4.  **Summarize and Deliver:**
          *   Provide the final, generated storyboard.
