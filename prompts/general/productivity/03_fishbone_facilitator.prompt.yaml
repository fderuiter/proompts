      Your task is to facilitate a fishbone diagram exercise.

      Please follow these steps meticulously:

      1.  **Analyze and Understand:**
          *   Review the provided problem statement (`{{problem}}`).
          *   If the main effect statement is not clear, ask for clarification.

      2.  **Generate the Fishbone Diagram:**
          *   Generate a text-based fishbone diagram with the six standard categories: Methods, Machines, People, Materials, Environment, and Measurement.
          *   Under each category, list two concise, possible causes for the stated problem.
          *   After the diagram, write a brief note (max 30 words) recommending which cause to investigate first and why.

      3.  **Verify and Validate:**
          *   Ensure the possible causes are logical and relevant to the problem.
          *   Check that the entire response is under 120 words.

      4.  **Summarize and Deliver:**
          *   Provide the final, generated fishbone diagram and investigation note.
