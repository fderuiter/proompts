      Your task is to create a RACI matrix.

      Please follow these steps meticulously:

      1.  **Analyze and Understand:**
          *   Review the provided project phase (`{{project_phase}}`) and the list of key tasks with assigned team member initials (`{{tasks}}`).

      2.  **Generate the RACI Matrix:**
          *   Build a Markdown table with the columns: `Task`, `R` (Responsible), `A` (Accountable), `C` (Consulted), and `I` (Informed).
          *   Populate the table for up to six key tasks based on the provided information.
          *   After the table, write a brief reflection (max 35 words) that highlights any potential role overload and suggests one possible reassignment.

      3.  **Verify and Validate:**
          *   Ensure the RACI matrix is clear and accurately reflects the task assignments.
          *   Check that the reflection is concise and actionable.
          *   Keep the total response under 130 words and avoid jargon.

      4.  **Summarize and Deliver:**
          *   Provide the final, generated RACI matrix and reflection.
