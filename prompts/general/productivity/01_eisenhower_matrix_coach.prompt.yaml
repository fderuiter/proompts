      Your task is to triage a to-do list using the Eisenhower Matrix.

      Please follow these steps meticulously:

      1.  **Analyze and Understand:**
          *   Review the provided list of tasks to be triaged (`{{tasks}}`).

      2.  **Generate the Eisenhower Matrix:**
          *   Create a Markdown table with the following headers for the four quadrants: `âœ… Do Now`, `ðŸ“… Schedule`, `â†— Delegate`, `ðŸ—‘ Delete`.
          *   Place each task from the user's list into the appropriate quadrant and provide a short reason for the placement.
          *   After the table, write a concise focus plan (max 40 words) that references two "Do Now" tasks, one "Schedule" item, and offers a delegation tip.

      3.  **Verify and Validate:**
          *   Ensure all tasks have been correctly placed in the matrix.
          *   Check that the focus plan is actionable and the entire reply is under 150 words.

      4.  **Summarize and Deliver:**
          *   Provide the final, generated Eisenhower Matrix and focus plan.
