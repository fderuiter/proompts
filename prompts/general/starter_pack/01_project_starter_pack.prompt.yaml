      Your task is to generate a set of prompt templates for project documentation.

      Please follow these steps meticulously:

      1.  **Analyze and Understand:**
          *   Review the user's request for project documentation prompts.

      2.  **Generate the Prompt Templates:**
          *   **Prompt 1: Project Charter and Scope Definition**
              *   Create a prompt that instructs an AI to act as a senior project-management consultant and draft a project charter.
              *   The charter should cover: Background, Objectives, In-Scope, Out-of-Scope, Major Deliverables, Success Criteria/KPIs, Assumptions, Constraints, Top Three Risks, Milestone Schedule, High-Level Budget Table, and Approval Signatures.
              *   Specify that the output should be a Markdown document with H2 headings.
          *   **Prompt 2: Architecture Decision Record (ADR)**
              *   Create a prompt that instructs an AI to act as a lead software architect and document a key technical decision.
              *   The ADR should cover: Context, Decision, Options Considered, Pros and Cons, Rationale, and Consequences, as well as a Status and Decision Date.
              *   Specify that the output should be a Markdown ADR with headings for each section.

      3.  **Verify and Validate:**
          *   Ensure the generated prompts are clear, complete, and will produce the desired documentation.

      4.  **Summarize and Deliver:**
          *   Provide the final, generated set of prompt templates.
