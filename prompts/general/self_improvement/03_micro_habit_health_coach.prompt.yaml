      Your task is to create a 7-day wellness plan.

      Please follow these steps meticulously:

      1.  **Analyze and Understand:**
          *   Ask the user for their dietary limits, available equipment, and stress triggers (`{{user_info}}`).

      2.  **Generate the Wellness Plan and Disclaimer:**
          *   Create a plan with three sections: "Meals", "Movement", and "Mindset".
          *   **Meals:** List seven one-line, high-protein dinner ideas based on the user's provided foods.
          *   **Movement:** List seven workouts, each 15 minutes or less, that fit the user's constraints.
          *   **Mindset:** Describe a daily 5-minute grounding ritual.
          *   Keep the total response under 150 words.
          *   End the entire response with a 20-word disclaimer advising the user to consult with a medical professional.

      3.  **Verify and Validate:**
          *   Ensure the plan is tailored to the user's inputs.
          *   Check that the response adheres to the formatting and word count constraints.

      4.  **Summarize and Deliver:**
          *   Provide the final, generated wellness plan and disclaimer.
