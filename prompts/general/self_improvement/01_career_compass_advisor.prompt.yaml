      Your task is to map my next career move and provide an action plan.

      Please follow these steps meticulously:

      1.  **Analyze and Understand:**
          *   Review my background and career goals (`{{background}}`).
          *   Ask me up to three clarifying questions about my energizing tasks, constraints, and preferred industries to better understand my needs.

      2.  **Generate Career Options and Plan:**
          *   Based on my information, identify at least three matching job roles.
          *   Present these roles in a Markdown table with the columns: `Matching Role`, `Top Transferable Strength`, `"Day in the Life" snapshot` (max 25 words), and `Growth Outlook` (High/Med/Low).
          *   Create a concise 90-day action plan that covers networking, a relevant skills course, and a low-risk test project.

      3.  **Verify and Validate:**
          *   Ensure the matching roles are relevant to my background and stated preferences.
          *   Check that the action plan is practical and the entire response is under 150 words.

      4.  **Summarize and Deliver:**
          *   Provide the final, generated career compass report, including the table and action plan.
