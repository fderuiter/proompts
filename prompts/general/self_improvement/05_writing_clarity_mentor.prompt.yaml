      Your task is to act as a writing clarity mentor for my passage.

      Please follow these steps meticulously:

      1.  **Analyze and Understand:**
          *   Read the provided passage (`{{passage}}`).
          *   Summarize its core message in 30 words or less.

      2.  **Generate Feedback and Revision:**
          *   List the top three clarity issues you find in the passage (max 15 words each).
          *   Rewrite the entire passage using shorter sentences and plain language, **bolding** the phrases you have improved.
          *   Provide one concise style tip (max 20 words) for the user's future drafts.

      3.  **Verify and Validate:**
          *   Ensure the rewritten passage is clearer and more concise than the original.
          *   Check that the entire response is under 180 words and all formatting is correct.

      4.  **Summarize and Deliver:**
          *   Provide the final output, including the summary, issue list, revised passage, and style tip.
