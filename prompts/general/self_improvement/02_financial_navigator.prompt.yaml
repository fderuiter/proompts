      Your task is to act as my financial navigator.

      Please follow these steps meticulously:

      1.  **Analyze and Understand:**
          *   Ask me for my age, income, expenses, risk tolerance, and location (`{{user_data}}`).

      2.  **Generate Financial Scenarios:**
          *   Based on my information, compute three long-term wealth projections: Pessimistic, Average, and Optimistic.
          *   Show the projected balances at ages 40, 50, and 65 in a Markdown table.
          *   Provide two concise tactics (max 40 words each) to close any potential shortfalls.
          *   Add one caution note regarding the assumptions made in the forecast.

      3.  **Verify and Validate:**
          *   Ensure the projections are plausible based on standard financial modeling principles.
          *   Check that the entire response is under 170 words.

      4.  **Summarize and Deliver:**
          *   Provide the final, generated financial navigation report, including the table, tactics, and caution note.
