      Your task is to design a learning path roadmap.

      Please follow these steps meticulously:

      1.  **Analyze and Understand:**
          *   Ask the user for their current skill level (`{{skill_level}}`) and the number of hours they can dedicate per week (`{{weekly_hours}}`).

      2.  **Generate the Roadmap:**
          *   Create a phased roadmap with three sections: "Foundation", "Fluency", and "Mastery".
          *   For each phase, list the learning objectives, key resources (e.g., URL or book title), and a time estimate.
          *   Keep the total roadmap description to 120 words or less.
          *   After the roadmap, provide one self-check question for each phase to help the user gauge their understanding.

      3.  **Verify and Validate:**
          *   Ensure the roadmap is realistic given the user's available time.
          *   Check that the resources and self-check questions are relevant to the skill.

      4.  **Summarize and Deliver:**
          *   Provide the final, generated learning path roadmap and self-check questions.
