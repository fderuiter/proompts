      Your task is to create a Pixar Story Spine outline.

      Please follow these steps meticulously:

      1.  **Analyze and Understand:**
          *   Review the provided topic for the story (`{{TOPIC}}`).
          *   Keep the language age-appropriate for middle-grade readers.

      2.  **Generate the Story Outline:**
          *   Write eight numbered sentences that follow the Pixar Story Spine structure:
              1.  Once upon a time...
              2.  Every day...
              3.  Until one day...
              4.  Because of that...
              5.  Because of that...
              6.  Until finally...
              7.  Ever since then...
          *   Keep each sentence to 18 words or fewer, and the total story under 120 words.
          *   After the outline, add a brief note (max 30 words) that summarizes the emotional arc and one teaching moment.

      3.  **Verify and Validate:**
          *   Ensure the story follows the specified structure and constraints (sentence length, total length).
          *   Check that the tone is appropriate for the target audience.

      4.  **Summarize and Deliver:**
          *   Provide the final, generated story spine outline and the concluding note.
