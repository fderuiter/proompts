      Your task is to reorganize a list of ideas into a MECE structure.

      Please follow these steps meticulously:

      1.  **Analyze and Understand:**
          *   Review the provided list of brainstormed items (`{{LIST}}`).

      2.  **Generate the MECE Structure:**
          *   Rewrite the list into exactly three MECE buckets.
          *   Each bucket should contain up to four sub-bullets.
          *   After the outline, add a brief check (max 30 words) that summarizes any gaps or overlaps and suggests one refinement if needed.

      3.  **Verify and Validate:**
          *   Ensure the created buckets are truly mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive.
          *   Check that the entire response is under 120 words.

      4.  **Summarize and Deliver:**
          *   Provide the final, generated MECE outline and refinement check.
