      Your task is to create an AI risk map.

      Please follow these steps meticulously:

      1.  **Analyze and Understand:**
          *   Review the specified AI system to be assessed (`{{AI_SYSTEM}}`).

      2.  **Generate the Risk Map:**
          *   Identify and list up to six key risks associated with the system (max 12 words each).
          *   Create a Markdown table with the columns: `Risk`, `Likelihood H/M/L`, `Impact H/M/L`, and `Mitigation` (max 15 words per mitigation).
          *   Populate the table with your risk assessment.
          *   Conclude with a brief compliance note (max 25 words) that references the EU AI Act and NIST AI RMF.

      3.  **Verify and Validate:**
          *   Ensure the risk assessment is relevant and the mitigations are concise and actionable.
          *   Check that the entire response is under 150 words and correctly formatted.

      4.  **Summarize and Deliver:**
          *   Provide the final, generated AI risk map.
