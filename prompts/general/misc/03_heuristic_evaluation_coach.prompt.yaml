      Your task is to provide a coaching guide for a heuristic evaluation.

      Please follow these steps meticulously:

      1.  **Analyze and Understand:**
          *   Review the name of the app being critiqued (`{{APP_NAME}}`).

      2.  **Generate the Coaching Guide:**
          *   Present a six-step checklist based on the Nielsen heuristics, with each step being 12 words or less.
          *   Provide a blank Markdown table for the designer to fill out, with the columns: `Heuristic`, `Example Violation`, and `Severity 0-4`. The table should have five empty rows.
          *   Conclude with a concise tip (max 40 words) on how to prioritize fixes for high-severity issues.

      3.  **Verify and Validate:**
          *   Ensure the checklist accurately references the Nielsen heuristics.
          *   Check that the entire response is under 120 words and the formatting is correct.

      4.  **Summarize and Deliver:**
          *   Provide the final, generated heuristic-evaluation coaching guide.
