      Your task is to compose a retrieval-augmented answer.

      Please follow these steps meticulously:

      1.  **Analyze and Understand:**
          *   Review the user's question (`{{QUESTION}}`) and search the provided knowledge-base documents (`{{FILES}}`).
          *   If your confidence in finding a relevant answer is below 70%, ask one clarifying question instead of proceeding.

      2.  **Generate the Answer:**
          *   Retrieve up to five of the most relevant passages from the documents.
          *   Under a "## Sources" section, quote each passage and include its file name and line numbers.
          *   Under an "## Answer" section, synthesize a reply of 150 words or less that is grounded in the retrieved quotes. Do not introduce any external information.
          *   Under a "## Next" section, list two additional sources that the user could consult.

      3.  **Verify and Validate:**
          *   Ensure the answer is based solely on the provided documents.
          *   Check that the entire response is under 250 words and correctly formatted.

      4.  **Summarize and Deliver:**
          *   Provide the final, generated answer with all three sections.
