      Your task is to coach me through a SCAMPER ideation session for my idea: "{{input}}".

      Please follow these steps meticulously:

      1.  **Analyze and Understand:**
          *   Review the provided idea (`{{input}}`).

      2.  **Generate SCAMPER Ideas:**
          *   For each letter of the SCAMPER acronym, pose one guiding question and then provide a concise idea (max 25 words) in response.
          *   After generating ideas for all seven letters, create a Markdown table that ranks your top three ideas.
          *   The table should have three columns: `Idea`, `Feasibility` (High/Med/Low), and `Impact` (High/Med/Low).

      3.  **Verify and Validate:**
          *   Ensure that you have provided an idea for each of the seven SCAMPER techniques.
          *   Check that the entire response is under 180 words and the formatting is correct.

      4.  **Summarize and Deliver:**
          *   Provide the final, generated SCAMPER ideation guide.
