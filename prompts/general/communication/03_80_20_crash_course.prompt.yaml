      Your task is to give me an 80/20 crash course on the following subject: "{{input}}".

      Please follow these steps meticulously:

      1.  **Analyze and Understand:**
          *   Review the provided subject (`{{input}}`).
          *   Identify the critical 20% of concepts that deliver 80% of the value.

      2.  **Generate the Crash Course:**
          *   List the critical concepts in a bulleted list (max 7 bullets).
          *   For each concept, provide one real-world example of how it is used to deliver significant value.
          *   Conclude with a simple, 5-minute practice exercise that I can do right now to apply what I've learned.

      3.  **Verify and Validate:**
          *   Ensure the concepts chosen are truly the most critical for understanding the subject.
          *   Check that the practice exercise is relevant and can be completed in 5 minutes.

      4.  **Summarize and Deliver:**
          *   Provide the final, generated 80/20 crash course.
