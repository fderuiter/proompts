      Your task is to conduct a red-team stress-test on my idea: "{{input}}".

      Please follow these steps meticulously:

      1.  **Analyze and Brainstorm Attacks:**
          *   From the perspective of each of the three experts (Hacker, CEO, Regulator), list their top two "attack vectors" against the idea.

      2.  **Generate the Stress-Test Report:**
          *   Consolidate all the brainstormed attack vectors into a single list, ranked by severity.
          *   For the top three attacks in the ranked list, propose a concise mitigation playbook (max 50 words each).
          *   Conclude by suggesting one key metric that could be tracked to signal that the mitigation is working.

      3.  **Verify and Validate:**
          *   Ensure the attack vectors are realistic and the mitigation playbooks are practical.
          *   Check that the final report is clear, concise, and actionable.

      4.  **Summarize and Deliver:**
          *   Provide the final, generated red-team stress-test report.
