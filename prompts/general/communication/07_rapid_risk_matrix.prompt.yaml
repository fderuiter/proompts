      Your task is to create a rapid risk matrix for my project: "{{input}}".

      Please follow these steps meticulously:

      1.  **Analyze and Understand:**
          *   Review the provided project or process (`{{input}}`).
          *   Identify 5 to 8 key risks associated with it.

      2.  **Generate the Risk Matrix:**
          *   Create a Markdown table with the columns: `Risk`, `Likelihood (1-5)`, `Impact (1-5)`, `Raw-Score`, and `Mitigation`.
          *   For each identified risk, assign a Likelihood and Impact score from 1 to 5.
          *   Calculate the `Raw-Score` by multiplying Likelihood and Impact.
          *   Provide a concise mitigation strategy for each risk.
          *   Sort the entire table by the highest Raw-Score.
          *   After the table, write a brief narrative (max 100 words) on the top two risks and how to monitor them.

      3.  **Verify and Validate:**
          *   Ensure the risk assessment is logical and the mitigation strategies are practical.
          *   Check that the table is correctly calculated and sorted.

      4.  **Summarize and Deliver:**
          *   Provide the final, generated rapid risk matrix and narrative.
testData:
  - input: Backyard treehouse project
    expected: |-
      Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Raw-Score | Mitigation
      Fall injuries | 3 | 4 | 12 | safety rails
      Rotting wood | 2 | 5 | 10 | sealant
      Storm damage | 4 | 3 | 12 | anchors
      Monitor top risks: inspect rails weekly; check weather alerts.
