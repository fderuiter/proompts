    content: |
      Your task is to facilitate an empathy map for the following user persona: "{{input}}".

      Please follow these steps meticulously:

      1.  **Analyze and Understand:**
          *   Review the provided user persona (`{{input}}`).

      2.  **Generate the Empathy Map:**
          *   Build a four-quadrant table summarizing what the persona "Says", "Thinks", "Does", and "Feels".
          *   Include two concise bullet points in each quadrant.
          *   After the table, write a brief insight paragraph (max 40 words) that summarizes the user's pain points and opportunities.
          *   Conclude with a single, insightful research question for the next step.

      3.  **Verify and Validate:**
          *   Ensure the empathy map accurately reflects the user persona.
          *   Check that the entire response is under 140 words and the formatting is correct.

      4.  **Summarize and Deliver:**
          *   Provide the final, generated empathy map.
