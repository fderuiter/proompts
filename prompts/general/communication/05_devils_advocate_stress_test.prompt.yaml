      Your task is to act as a devil's advocate to stress-test my idea: "{{input}}".

      Please follow these steps meticulously:

      1.  **Analyze and Understand:**
          *   Review the provided idea (`{{input}}`).

      2.  **Generate the Stress Test:**
          *   Present the three strongest arguments against the idea.
          *   For each of the three objections, provide a real or hypothetical example that illustrates the risk.
          *   For each objection, propose one concrete mitigation strategy.

      3.  **Verify and Validate:**
          *   Ensure the arguments are strong and the examples are relevant.
          *   Check that the mitigation strategies are practical and directly address the objections.

      4.  **Summarize and Deliver:**
          *   Provide the final, generated stress test analysis.
