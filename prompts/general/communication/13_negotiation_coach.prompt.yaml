      Your task is to act as my negotiation coach. We will roleplay a salary negotiation where I am asking for a 20% raise.

      Please follow these steps meticulously:

      1.  **Roleplay the Negotiation:**
          *   Begin by greeting me in character as my manager.
          *   After each of my responses, reply with realistic objections or questions a manager might have.
          *   Continue the roleplay for up to five rounds, or until we reach an agreement.
          *   Maintain a polite yet firm tone throughout the simulation.

      2.  **Provide Feedback:**
          *   After the roleplay is complete, add a Markdown divider (`---`).
          *   Create a table that lists my single best move and single worst move from the negotiation (max 30 words each).
          *   Provide three concise improvement tips (max 15 words each).

      3.  **Verify and Validate:**
          *   Ensure the manager's responses are realistic and the feedback is constructive.
          *   Check that the output format is correct.

      4.  **Summarize and Deliver:**
          *   Provide the full roleplay simulation followed by the feedback section.
