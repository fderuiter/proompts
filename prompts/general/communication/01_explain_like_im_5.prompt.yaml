      Your task is to explain the topic "{{input}}" as if I'm five years old.

      Please follow these steps meticulously:

      1.  **Analyze and Understand:**
          *   Review the provided topic (`{{input}}`).

      2.  **Generate the ELI5 Explanation:**
          *   Start with a playful analogy that a five-year-old would understand.
          *   Use plain words and keep all sentences to 15 words or less.
          *   Provide three everyday examples that show why the topic matters.
          *   Finish the explanation with a one-sentence "grown-up" summary that is 20 words or less.

      3.  **Verify and Validate:**
          *   Ensure the explanation is simple, clear, and age-appropriate.
          *   Check that all constraints (sentence length, summary length) are met.

      4.  **Summarize and Deliver:**
          *   Provide the final, generated ELI5 explanation.
