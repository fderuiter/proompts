      Your task is to create a pitch deck outline for my idea: "{{input}}".

      Please follow these steps meticulously:

      1.  **Analyze and Understand:**
          *   Review the provided idea (`{{input}}`).

      2.  **Generate the Pitch Deck Outline:**
          *   Provide eight slide titles, each with bulleted content of 12 words or less.
          *   For the two most critical slides, suggest a visual cue (e.g., an icon or a chart type).
          *   Note the single most important success metric to emphasize in the pitch.

      3.  **Verify and Validate:**
          *   Ensure the outline is clear, concise, and prioritizes brevity for a fast pitch.
          *   Check that the total output is 120 words or less.

      4.  **Summarize and Deliver:**
          *   Provide the final, generated pitch deck outline.
