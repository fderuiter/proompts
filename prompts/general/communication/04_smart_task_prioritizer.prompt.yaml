      Your task is to prioritize my to-do list.

      Please follow these steps meticulously:

      1.  **Analyze and Understand:**
          *   Review my provided to-do list (`{{input}}`).

      2.  **Generate the Prioritized List:**
          *   Create a Markdown table with the columns: `Task`, `Urgency (1-5)`, `Impact (1-5)`, `Effort (1-5)`, and `Priority Score`.
          *   For each task, assign a score from 1 to 5 for Urgency, Impact, and Effort.
          *   Calculate the `Priority Score` using the formula: (Impact * Urgency) / Effort.
          *   Sort the table by the highest Priority Score.
          *   After the table, suggest the first three tasks I should do and explain your reasoning in two sentences for each.

      3.  **Verify and Validate:**
          *   Ensure the scoring and calculations are logical and correct.
          *   Check that the table is correctly sorted and the final recommendations are clear.

      4.  **Summarize and Deliver:**
          *   Provide the final, generated prioritized task list and recommendations.
