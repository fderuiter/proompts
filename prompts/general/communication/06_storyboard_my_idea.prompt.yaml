      Your task is to storyboard my idea: "{{input}}".

      Please follow these steps meticulously:

      1.  **Analyze and Understand:**
          *   Review the provided project or message to be storyboarded (`{{input}}`).

      2.  **Generate the Storyboard:**
          *   Create a storyboard with exactly six frames.
          *   For each frame, provide the following three components:
              a. A scene description.
              b. On-screen text (max 15 words).
              c. A suggested voice-over (max 20 words).
          *   Conclude the storyboard with a one-sentence emotional takeaway for the viewer.

      3.  **Verify and Validate:**
          *   Ensure the storyboard tells a clear and compelling story within the six frames.
          *   Check that all word count constraints are met.
