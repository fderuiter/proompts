    1. Clean and aggregate events to MedDRA Preferred Term.

    2. Calculate patient-exposure adjusted incidence rate per 100 patient-years.

    3. Compute proportional reporting ratio (PRR).

    4. Identify any term with PRR > 2 and at least three events.

    5. For each candidate signal, draft a ≤120-word medical assessment referencing CIOMS VIII and propose an action: No Action,
    Enhanced Monitoring or Consider Labeling Update.


    Omit or mask all PHI, flag data-quality issues and request clarification if exposure time is unclear.'
