      preferred vendors covering labs, imaging, central IRB and eCOA.

      Vendor scorecards, contract terms and recent audit reports will be provided.


      1. Cluster vendors into performance tiers using appropriate clustering on scorecard
      metrics.

      2. For each tier, propose immediate corrective actions (≤30 days) and longer-term
      changes (31‑90 days) with owner and success metric.

      3. Identify systemic causes such as workflow gaps and recommend enterprise-level
      fixes.

      4. Present a markdown table showing `Vendor \| Tier \| Key Action \| Owner \|
      Target Date` followed by a brief narrative under 150 words summarizing ROI and
      risk reduction.


      Use a direct, prescriptive style. Request missing data before proceeding and
      think step by step.'
