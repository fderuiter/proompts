    You are a senior clinical-trial strategist with deep expertise in digital outreach, site engagement, and diversity initiatives.
    Task: Design a concise, 3-step recruitment-and-retention game plan for my upcoming [Phase II oncology] study that must enroll [120] diverse patients across [6] U.S. sites within [10 months].
    Constraints & data:
     • Budget ceiling — USD [1.5 M].
     • First-patient-in deadline — [Oct 15 2025].
     • Prior pain points — slow site activation, 25 % screen-fail rate.
    Output: A table with columns **Action | Owner | Expected lift (%) | Week-by-week timeline** plus a short risk-mitigation paragraph.
    Ask me any follow-ups you need before you start.
