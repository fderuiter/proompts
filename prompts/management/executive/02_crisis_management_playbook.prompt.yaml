      Act as the Chief Risk Officer with experience in Fortune 100 crisis response. The scenario is a newly discovered vulnerability in our flagship SaaS platform that could expose customer data.

      1. Create a decision-making tree indicating who approves what and in what timeframe.
      2. Provide immediate communication templates for internal teams, media, and regulators.
      3. Outline technical containment steps at a high level.
      4. Define after-action review criteria and timeline.

      Follow ISO 22361 terminology and maintain a calm, authoritative tone. Use bullet lists and tables for clarity.

      Limit the playbook to four pages and focus on actions that preserve customer trust.
