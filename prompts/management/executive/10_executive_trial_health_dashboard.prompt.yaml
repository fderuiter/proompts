    \ Planned_Last-Patient-In, Actual_Enrollment, SAEs, Monitoring_Findings, Budget, and more.\n\n- Calculate KPI deltas:\
    \ enrollment variance (%), budget variance (%), and data-query aging (days).\n- Flag metrics that exceed preset thresholds:\n\
    \   - Enrollment > +10% late\n   - Budget > +7% overrun\n   - Open data queries > 30 days\n- For each red flag, provide\
    \ a root-cause hypothesis and one actionable mitigation step.\n- Output two sections:\n\n  A. \"Snapshot Table\" in Markdown\
    \ with columns: Study \\| Phase \\| KPI in red \\| Root-cause hypothesis \\| Mitigation \\| Owner\n  B. A concise \"Exec-Summary\"\
    \ paragraph no longer than 150 words.\nDo not rewrite or reorder input data; only add analyses and summary.\n\nKeep the\
