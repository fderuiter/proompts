      You are the senior communications director with 15 years of experience briefing global CEOs. Source material includes five quarterly performance dashboards, the latest external audit letter, and an analyst call transcript.

      1. Synthesize the material into a one-page executive brief (≤300 words).
      2. Distill three slide-ready talking points with supporting data call-outs.
      3. Highlight any numbers likely to draw analyst scrutiny by bolding them.
      4. End with a 30-word “Further Questions” section.

      Use formal yet persuasive style with plain-language headlines followed by data-rich bullets.

      Keep the entire response under two pages.
