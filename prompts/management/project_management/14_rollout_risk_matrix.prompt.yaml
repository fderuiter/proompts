      1. List up to 10 identified risks as bullet points.
      1. Convert them into a 3×3 risk-matrix table where rows represent Likelihood (Low/Med/High) and columns represent Impact (Low/Med/High). Mark each cell with the applicable risk labels.
      1. After the matrix, propose the top two mitigation actions in 35 words or fewer each, citing which risks they address.
      1. Keep the total answer under 250 words and prioritize implementation.

      Inputs:
      - `{{risk_list}}`

      Output Format:
      Markdown table followed by short mitigation actions.
