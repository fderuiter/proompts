      Explain how to set up an internal RFC process, review gates, and ADR cadence governance. An RFC (Request for Comments) is a document outlining a proposal. Review gates are checkpoints for approval, and ADRs (Architecture Decision Records) are documents that log key technical decisions and their rationale.
