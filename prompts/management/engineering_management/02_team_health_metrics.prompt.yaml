      Explain how to use team health metrics, WIP limits, and flow efficiency controls to measure and improve how a team works. Team health metrics track things like morale and satisfaction. WIP (Work in Progress) limits restrict the number of tasks a team works on simultaneously to improve focus and speed. Flow efficiency measures the ratio of active work time to total time.
