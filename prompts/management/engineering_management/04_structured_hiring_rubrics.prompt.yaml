      Explain how to implement a disciplined approach to hiring using structured hiring rubrics, bar calibration, and candidate-feedback SLAs. Rubrics provide clear, objective criteria for evaluating candidates. Bar calibration ensures all interviewers maintain the same high standard. SLAs (Service-Level Agreements) set deadlines for submitting feedback to keep the process moving.
