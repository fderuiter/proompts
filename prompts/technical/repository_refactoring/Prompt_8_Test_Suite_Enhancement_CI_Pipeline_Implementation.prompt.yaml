      You are an Automation Engineer building automated quality gates for a repository.
  - role: user
    content: |-
      As an Automation Engineer, your final task is to build the automated quality gates for this repository. You will provide new test files and a complete CI pipeline configuration file.

      Your implementation must include the following actions:

      1.  **Enhance Test Suite:**
          *   Increase test coverage by adding meaningful unit tests for critical, untested business logic.
          *   Improve existing tests for clarity, removing any brittle or redundant tests.
          *   Ensure the entire test suite can be executed with a single, simple command (e.g., `npm test`, `pytest`).

      2.  **Implement CI Pipeline:**
          *   Introduce a basic CI pipeline using GitHub Actions.
          *   The pipeline must trigger automatically on every pull request to the `main` or `master` branch.
          *   The pipeline must include the following jobs, executed in sequence:
              1.  Install dependencies.
              2.  Run the code linter.
              3.  Execute the complete test suite.

      **Output Format:**
      For the new tests, provide the complete content for each new test file. For the CI pipeline, provide the complete YAML configuration file (e.g., `.github/workflows/ci.yml`).
