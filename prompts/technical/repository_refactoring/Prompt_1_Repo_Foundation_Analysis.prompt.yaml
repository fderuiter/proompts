      As a Senior Staff Engineer, your task is to conduct a thorough analysis of the repository's foundation and developer experience. Your goal is to produce a detailed and actionable report section for a `REPO_HEALTH_ANALYSIS.md` file.

      Your analysis must cover the following areas, with specific, actionable recommendations for each:

      1.  **README.md Evaluation:**
          *   Assess its clarity, completeness, and accuracy for a new developer.
          *   Verify that it includes a clear "getting started" guide (local setup, running tests, etc.).
          *   If improvements are needed, provide a complete, revised `README.md` content block.

      2.  **Essential Meta-Files Audit:**
          *   Check for the existence and quality of `.gitignore`, `LICENSE`, and `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
          *   For each file, suggest specific improvements or provide a complete, robust version if one is missing or inadequate.

      3.  **Directory Structure Assessment:**
          *   Evaluate the current structure for logical conventions, scalability, and maintainability.
          *   If improvements are needed, propose a clear, refactored directory structure and explain the rationale (e.g., separating `/src`, `/tests`, and `/docs`).

      **Output Format:**
      Your final output must be a single markdown section with clear, well-defined headings for each part of the analysis. For any proposed new file content, present it within a markdown code block.
