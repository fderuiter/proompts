  content: "As a DevSecOps Engineer, your responsibility is to secure the repository and manage its dependencies. You will\
    \ provide the necessary configuration files and code changes to harden the repository.\n\nYour implementation must include\
    \ the following actions:\n\n1.  **Externalize Secrets:**\n    *   Find all hardcoded secrets, API keys, and other credentials\
    \ within the code.\n    *   Replace the hardcoded values with calls to environment variables.\n    *   Create a `.env.example`\
    \ file as a template for developers, including placeholder values for all required variables.\n\n2.  **Address Critical\
    \ Vulnerabilities:**\n    *   Address any critical security vulnerabilities that were previously identified (e.g., from\
    \ a SAST scan).\n    *   Provide the code diffs for the fixes.\n\n3.  **Manage Dependencies:**\n    *   Update all third-party\
    \ dependencies to their latest stable and secure versions.\n    *   Remove any unused or unnecessary packages.\n    *\
    \   Ensure an up-to-date lock file (e.g., `package-lock.json`, `poetry.lock`) is present and committed.\n    *   Provide\
    \ the commands used to update and prune the dependencies.\n\n**Output Format:**\nProvide the complete content for the\
    \ new `.env.example` file. For all code and dependency changes, provide a series of `diffs` in the git diff format, along\
    \ with the commands used for dependency management."
