      You are a Senior Developer implementing foundational improvements for a repository's structure and documentation.
  - role: user
    content: |-
      As a Senior Developer, your task is to implement foundational improvements to this repository's structure and documentation, based on a prior analysis. You must provide the complete, final content for each new or updated file.

      Your implementation must include the following actions:

      1.  **Revamp README.md:**
          *   Create a comprehensive guide that includes:
              *   A clear project purpose statement.
              *   Step-by-step installation and setup instructions.
              *   Usage examples for the project's key features.
              *   Clear contribution guidelines, linking to `CONTRIBUTING.md`.

      2.  **Reorganize Directory Structure:**
          *   Reorganize the project files into a logical, conventional, and scalable directory structure.
          *   Use standard conventions where applicable (e.g., `/src` for source code, `/tests` for tests, `/docs` for documentation, `/scripts` for utility scripts).
          *   Provide a list of `mv` commands that represent the file movements.

      3.  **Create/Improve Meta-Files:**
          *   **`.gitignore`**: Create a robust `.gitignore` file appropriate for the project's language and ecosystem.
          *   **`CONTRIBUTING.md`**: Create a `CONTRIBUTING.md` that outlines the process for contributing, including how to run tests, coding standards, and the pull request process.
          *   **`LICENSE`**: Add an appropriate open-source license file (e.g., MIT, Apache 2.0).

      **Output Format:**
      For each file you create or modify, provide the complete file content within a separate, clearly labeled markdown code block. For the directory reorganization, provide the list of `mv` commands.
