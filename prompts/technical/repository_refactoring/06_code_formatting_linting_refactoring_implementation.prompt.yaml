  content: "As a Staff Engineer, your assignment is to improve the codebase's internal quality and consistency. You will provide\
    \ the necessary configuration files and the refactored code.\n\nYour implementation must include the following actions:\n\
    \n1.  **Introduce Tooling:**\n    *   Introduce and configure a standard code formatter (e.g., Prettier, Black) and a\
    \ linter (e.g., ESLint, Ruff).\n    *   Provide the complete content for the configuration files (e.g., `.prettierrc`,\
    \ `.eslintrc.js`).\n    *   Provide the commands to run these tools across the entire codebase.\n\n2.  **Refactor Complex\
    \ Code:**\n    *   Identify and refactor complex, monolithic functions and classes into smaller, single-responsibility\
    \ units.\n    *   Focus on improving readability and maintainability.\n\n3.  **Improve Code Clarity:**\n    *   Improve\
    \ the naming of variables and functions to be more descriptive and intuitive.\n    *   Eliminate duplicated code by extracting\
    \ it into reusable helper functions or classes.\n\n**Output Format:**\nFor new configuration files, provide the complete\
    \ content in a labeled markdown code block. For the code changes, provide a series of `diffs` in the git diff format,\
    \ each with a clear explanation of the refactoring rationale."
