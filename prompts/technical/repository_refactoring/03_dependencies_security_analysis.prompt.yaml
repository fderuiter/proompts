      As a Security and DevOps specialist, you must perform a thorough audit of the repository's dependencies and overall security posture to identify and mitigate risks.

      Your audit must cover the following areas, providing a prioritized list of vulnerabilities and actionable recommendations:

      1.  **Dependency Audit:**
          *   Use a dependency scanning tool to identify all third-party dependencies with known vulnerabilities (CVEs).
          *   For each vulnerable dependency, specify the package, the vulnerability, and the recommended version to patch to.
          *   Identify any deprecated or unmaintained packages and suggest modern, secure alternatives.

      2.  **Secrets Scanning:**
          *   Scan the entire codebase for hardcoded secrets, API keys, or other credentials.
          *   For each finding, specify the file and line number, and provide a clear recommendation for externalizing it (e.g., using environment variables, a secrets management tool).

      3.  **Static Application Security Testing (SAST):**
          *   Scan the codebase for common security flaws such as SQL injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and insecure direct object references.
          *   For each potential flaw, provide the file and code snippet, and explain the potential impact and how to remediate it.

      **Output Format:**
      Your final output must be a single markdown section with clear, well-defined headings for each part of the analysis. Findings should be presented in a table format where applicable (e.g., for dependencies), ordered by severity (Critical, High, Medium, Low).

      Example Structure:
      ```markdown
      ### Dependency Audit
      | Package | Vulnerability | Severity | Recommendation |
      |---|---|---|---|
      | ... | ... | ... | ... |

      ### Secrets Scanning
      *   **File:** `src/config.js:12`, **Secret:** Hardcoded API Key, **Recommendation:** Move to environment variable `API_KEY`.
