      Based on a prior analysis, revamp the README.md into a comprehensive guide covering installation, usage, and contribution. Reorganize the project files into a logical, conventional, and scalable directory structure (e.g., using /src, /tests, /docs). Finally, create or improve the essential meta-files, including a robust .gitignore, a clear CONTRIBUTING.md with contribution guidelines, and an appropriate LICENSE file (e.g., MIT). Provide the complete file contents for each of these updated or new documents.
