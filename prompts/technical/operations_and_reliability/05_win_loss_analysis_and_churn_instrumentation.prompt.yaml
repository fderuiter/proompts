      Develop a systematic program for conducting winâ€“loss analysis for our sales process and instrumenting the drivers of customer churn. The program should outline a repeatable process for interviewing recent wins, competitive losses, and churned customers to gather qualitative insights. It must also specify the product analytics and telemetry needed to identify in-app behaviors that are leading indicators of churn. The final part of the program should be a formal feedback loop for synthesizing these quantitative and qualitative findings into prioritized inputs for the product roadmap.
