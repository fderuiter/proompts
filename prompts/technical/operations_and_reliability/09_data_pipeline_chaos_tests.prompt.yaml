      Explain data-pipeline chaos tests, backfill safety, and reconciliation SLOs. Chaos tests involve intentionally injecting failures to see how the system reacts. Backfill safety ensures that reprocessing historical data doesn't cause problems. Reconciliation SLOs (Service-Level Objectives) set goals for ensuring data is consistent across different systems.
