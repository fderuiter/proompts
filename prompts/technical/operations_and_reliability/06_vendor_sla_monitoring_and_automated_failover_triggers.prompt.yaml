      Design a system for actively monitoring the Service Level Agreements (SLAs) of our critical third-party API vendors and SaaS providers. This system should go beyond simple uptime checks by ingesting vendor status pages and performance metrics programmatically. Crucially, it must include a plan for configuring automated failover triggers. Describe how, if a primary vendor breaches its performance or availability SLA, our system will automatically reroute traffic to a secondary provider or switch to a gracefully degraded operational mode without manual intervention.
