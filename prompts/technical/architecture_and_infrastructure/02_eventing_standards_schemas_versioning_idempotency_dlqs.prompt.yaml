      Draft a set of engineering standards for our organization's event-driven architecture to ensure reliability and scalability. The standards must address four key areas: 1) Schema definition and the benefits of a schema registry; 2) Event versioning strategies that ensure backward and forward compatibility; 3) The importance of designing idempotent consumers to safely handle duplicate message delivery; and 4) A robust strategy for handling processing failures using Dead-Letter Queues (DLQs), including monitoring and replay procedures.
