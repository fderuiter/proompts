      Explain how to design and implement a producer-consumer data contract framework to ensure reliable, decoupled data exchange between autonomous microservices or teams. Detail the core components of a contract, including schema definition (e.g., using Protobuf, Avro, or JSON Schema), semantic guarantees, and versioning strategy. Describe how these contracts can be enforced automatically in a CI/CD pipeline (e.g., using a schema registry) to prevent producers from making breaking changes that would impact downstream consumers.
