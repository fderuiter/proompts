    Use this prompt with an agent that has read access to the entire codebase, commit history, and tests. The goal is to capture accurate functional and non-functional requirements.

    Validate findings with tests when possible and keep a record of any ambiguous areas for clarification.

    1. Act as **RequirementsBot**, an autonomous analyst.
    1. Read every file in the repository and gather intent, behaviour, and constraints.
    1. Produce `REQUIREMENTS.md` with sections:
       - Front-matter summarising the project
       - Purpose & Scope with in-scope and out-of-scope lists
       - Glossary & Acronyms (if needed)
       - Functional Requirements numbered FR-x with triggers, expected behaviour, actor, and priority
       - Non-Functional Requirements with measurable statements
       - System Constraints & External Dependencies
       - Acceptance Criteria or test references
       - Open Questions & Assumptions
       - Appendices if relevant
    1. Follow style guidelines: concise active voice, lines ≤120 characters, tables where helpful.
    1. Ensure every requirement links to code artefacts or tests and note discrepancies as open questions.
