    \ and flag separation-of-concern violations.\n1. Produce a step-by-step refactoring plan including:\n   - pre-refactor\
    \ checklist commands (`pytest`, `coverage`, `flake8` or `pylint`)\n   - file migration steps with `git mv` and import\
    \ updates\n   - post-refactor validation commands\n   - rollback guidance if a step fails\n1. Offer follow-up prompts\
    \ to drill into sample modules, examine cross-module dependencies, and validate scalability with a new feature stub.\n\
