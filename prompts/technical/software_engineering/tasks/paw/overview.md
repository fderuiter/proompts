# Principal Architect Workflow (PAW)

The **Principal Architect Workflow (PAW)** transforms software engineering tasks into a disciplined, state-machine driven process. It breaks cognitive load into discrete phases to ensure architectural integrity, code quality, and maintainability.

## 🔗 The Chain

1.  **Tactical Recon (The "What")**:
    *   **Goal**: Extract the current state and identify the delta.
    *   **Artifact**: Tactical Brief (Task, Dependency Graph, Code Smells).

2.  **Architectural Blueprint (The "How")**:
    *   **Goal**: Design the solution before coding.
    *   **Artifact**: Design Spec (Patterns, Refactor Plan, State Safety).

3.  **Precision Strike (The "Implementation")**:
    *   **Goal**: Execute the code change with surgical accuracy.
    *   **Artifact**: Implemented Code.

4.  **Quality Assurance & Log (The "Verify")**:
    *   **Goal**: Close the loop and update the project state.
    *   **Artifact**: Final Confirmation and Updated `TODO.md`.

## 🛠️ Usage

This workflow is designed to be run as a chain. The output of each step feeds into the next, ensuring that design decisions are respected during implementation and verification.
