# Overview of Codex Prompts

This folder houses prompts tailored for OpenAI Codex and ChatGPT usage. They provide scaffolding, tooling, CI/CD, and onboarding instructions for new repositories, plus a codebase testing plan.

The core **Codex Prompt Suite** is split across four files:

1. `01_project_init.prompt.yaml`
1. `03_tooling_and_quality.prompt.yaml`
1. `04_ci_cd.prompt.yaml`
1. `05_docs_and_onboarding.prompt.yaml`

Run these prompts sequentially in a fresh ChatGPT session to scaffold and document a new project.
