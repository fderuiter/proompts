      Your task is to create the initial set of documentation for the new FastAPI project to ensure it is easy to understand, contribute to, and maintain.

      Please follow these steps meticulously:

      1.  **Analyze Documentation Needs**:
          - Review the project structure and goals to identify the essential documentation needed for a new developer.

      2.  **Create Foundational Documents**:
          - Write a `README.md` with a project overview and detailed setup instructions.
          - Write a `CONTRIBUTING.md` outlining the development workflow and PR process.
          - Create a `pull_request_template.md` and a `CODEOWNERS` file.

      3.  **Establish Architectural Decision Records (ADRs)**:
          - Create a `docs/adr` directory with an ADR template.
          - Write the first two ADRs for key initial decisions (e.g., "Choose Pydantic BaseSettings for Config", "Use SQLAlchemy 2.0 Async Engine").

      4.  **Validate Documentation Quality**:
          - Review the created documents for clarity, conciseness, and accuracy.
          - The final documentation must be sufficient for a new developer to get the project running and contribute without assistance. Confirm this by following the steps yourself.
