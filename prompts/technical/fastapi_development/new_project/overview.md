# New FastAPI Project Prompts

This collection of prompts guides an agent in bootstrapping a production-ready FastAPI application from the ground up.

The workflow covers all essential aspects of a modern asynchronous web service, including:
- Initial project setup with dependency management and static analysis tools.
- Typed, environment-driven configuration using Pydantic.
- Establishing a versioned API with dependency injection and automated documentation.
- Implementing standard authentication and authorization (e.g., OAuth2/JWT).
- Setting up an asynchronous data layer with SQLAlchemy 2.x and Alembic migrations.
- Building a robust testing harness for async code.
- Integrating background job processing.
- Implementing caching and security best practices.
- Dockerizing the application for development and production parity.
- Setting up CI/CD pipelines and observability.
- Creating essential documentation and architectural decision records.

Each prompt represents a distinct step in the project creation process, resulting in a well-structured and maintainable codebase.
