      Your task is to instrument the new FastAPI application for excellent observability from day one, providing visibility into traces, metrics, and errors.

      Please follow these steps meticulously:

      1.  **Analyze Observability Requirements**:
          - Review project goals to identify the need for error monitoring, tracing, metrics, and structured logging.

      2.  **Implement Error Monitoring and Tracing**:
          - Instrument the application with Sentry or an OpenTelemetry (OTEL) SDK using their ASGI integrations.

      3.  **Implement Metrics and Structured Logging**:
          - Add a Prometheus exporter to expose RED metrics at a `/metrics` endpoint.
          - Ensure the logging setup produces structured (JSON) logs and uses a request correlation ID.

      4.  **Validate the Observability Stack**:
          - Add local instances of observability tools (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana) to `docker-compose.yml`.
          - Write **new tests** or manually verify that errors are captured, the `/metrics` endpoint works, and logs are structured and correlated.
          - Create an `observability.md` document explaining the setup.
