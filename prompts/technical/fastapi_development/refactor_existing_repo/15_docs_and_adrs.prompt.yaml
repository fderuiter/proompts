      Your task is to create a set of essential documentation to make the repository self-explaining and easy for new developers to onboard, and to establish a process for recording important architectural decisions.

      Please follow these steps meticulously:

      1.  **Analyze Existing Documentation**:
          - Review existing documentation (`README.md`, etc.) to find gaps or outdated information.

      2.  **Create and Update Foundational Documents**:
          - Write or update the `README.md` (with setup instructions), `CONTRIBUTING.md` (with workflow), and a `pull_request_template.md`.
          - Ensure the `CODEOWNERS` file is up-to-date.

      3.  **Establish Architectural Decision Records (ADRs)**:
          - Create a `docs/adr` directory with a template.
          - Write at least two initial ADRs for significant refactoring decisions (e.g., "Adopt Async SQLAlchemy", "Choose Arq for Background Tasks").

      4.  **Validate Documentation Quality**:
          - Review the created documents for clarity, conciseness, and accuracy.
          - The final documentation should be sufficient for a new developer to get started in under an hour. Confirm this by following the steps yourself.
