# Refactor Existing FastAPI Repo Prompts

This series of prompts provides a structured, phased approach to refactoring and modernizing an existing FastAPI repository.

The process begins with a comprehensive audit of the repository to identify key areas for improvement. Subsequent prompts guide the agent through a series of targeted refactoring activities, including:
- Adopting a centralized, typed configuration system.
- Modularizing the codebase into cohesive components with clear boundaries.
- Improving dependency management and hygiene.
- Establishing a baseline for testing, static analysis, and type checking.
- Hardening the data layer with an async ORM and introducing migrations.
- Adding support for background jobs and caching.
- Enhancing security, observability, and documentation.
- Improving the local development experience with Docker.
- Setting up a robust CI/CD pipeline.

Each prompt is a self-contained step that moves the repository towards a more modern, maintainable, and scalable architecture without changing existing behavior.
