      Your task is to implement a new feature in the codebase.

      Please follow these steps meticulously:

      1.  **Analyze and Identify:**
          *   Review the feature requirements to understand the desired functionality.
          *   Analyze the existing codebase to determine the best approach for implementation and identify the files that will be affected.
          *   Outline the new components, functions, or classes that will be needed.

      2.  **Implement the Change:**
          *   Write high-quality, well-documented code for the new feature.
          *   Follow the project's existing architectural patterns and coding conventions.
          *   Write comprehensive unit tests that cover the new functionality.

      3.  **Verify and Validate:**
          *   Run the new tests to ensure the feature works as expected.
          *   Run the entire existing test suite to guarantee that your changes have not introduced any regressions.

      4.  **Report or Summarize:**
          *   Provide a summary of the new feature you have implemented.
          *   Describe the changes you made and confirm that all tests are passing.
