      Your task is to fix a bug in the codebase.

      Please follow these steps meticulously:

      1.  **Analyze and Identify:**
          *   First, analyze the provided bug description and any accompanying information (like error logs or screenshots) to understand the issue.
          *   Explore the codebase to pinpoint the root cause of the bug.
          *   Identify the specific files and functions that need to be modified to resolve the issue.

      2.  **Implement the Change:**
          *   Write clean, efficient, and correct code to fix the bug.
          *   Adhere strictly to the existing coding conventions and style of the project.
          *   Create a new unit test that specifically verifies the fix. This test should fail before the fix is applied and pass afterward.

      3.  **Verify and Validate:**
          *   Run the new test to confirm that the bug has been successfully resolved.
          *   Execute the entire existing test suite to ensure that your changes have not introduced any regressions.

      4.  **Report or Summarize:**
          *   Provide a clear and concise summary of the work you have done.
          *   Explain the nature of the bug, the changes you made to fix it, and confirm that all tests (both new and existing) are now passing.
