      Your task is to create or modify the CI/CD pipeline for this project.

      Please follow these steps meticulously:

      1.  **Analyze and Identify:**
          *   Review the user's requirements for the pipeline (e.g., build, test, deploy environments, target platform).
          *   Analyze the existing project structure and tooling to ensure compatibility.
          *   Identify the necessary pipeline configuration files to be created or modified (e.g., `ci.yml`, `deploy.yml`).

      2.  **Implement the Change:**
          *   Write the pipeline configuration code (e.g., GitHub Actions YAML).
          *   Follow best practices for CI/CD, such as caching dependencies, running tests, and managing secrets securely.
          *   Include steps for building, testing, and deploying the application as required.
          *   Add documentation explaining how to use and maintain the pipeline.

      3.  **Verify and Validate:**
          *   Validate the syntax of the configuration files.
          *   Provide instructions on how the user can test the new pipeline (e.g., by making a test commit or running a workflow manually).

      4.  **Report or Summarize:**
          *   Provide a summary of the CI/CD pipeline you have created.
          *   Explain the purpose of each workflow and any new files added.
          *   List any necessary follow-up actions for the user, such as adding secrets.
