      Create a governance policy for the management and use of data in non-production environments. The policy must strictly prohibit the use of real customer data for development or testing purposes. It should champion the use of synthetic data generation and other privacy-enhancing techniques to create realistic, high-quality test datasets. The policy should also outline a centralized process for managing and provisioning these safe datasets to development and QA teams.
