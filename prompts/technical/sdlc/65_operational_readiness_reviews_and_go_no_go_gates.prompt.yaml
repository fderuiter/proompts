      Design a formal process for conducting Operational Readiness Reviews (ORRs) prior to any major service or feature launch. The process should include a standardized checklist that engineering teams must complete, covering key areas like monitoring coverage, alerting configuration, documentation of runbooks, completion of performance and capacity testing, and a finalized rollback plan. Define the stakeholders who must be present at the review and establish clear, objective criteria for making a final "go/no-go" decision at the release gate.
