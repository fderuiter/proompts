      Design a modern network architecture for our cloud environment based on a zero-trust security model. Your proposal must explain the core principle of "never trust, always verify," detailing how this translates to practices like micro-segmentation, strong identity-based authentication for all services, and default-deny network policies. Additionally, outline a strict strategy for controlling and monitoring all egress traffic to prevent data exfiltration. Finally, explain how eBPF (extended Berkeley Packet Filter) can be leveraged for deep, low-overhead network observability and security enforcement without requiring application-level agents.
