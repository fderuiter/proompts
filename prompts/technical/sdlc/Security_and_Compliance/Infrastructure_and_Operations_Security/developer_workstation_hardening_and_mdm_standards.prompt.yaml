      Create a security standard for hardening all developer workstations to protect our source code and infrastructure access. The standard must specify mandatory configurations, including full-disk encryption, firewall settings, required security software (EDR), and the principle of least privilege for user accounts. It must also require the enrollment of all company-owned devices into our Mobile Device Management (MDM) solution to enable centralized policy enforcement, automated patching, and remote wipe capabilities in case of loss or theft.
