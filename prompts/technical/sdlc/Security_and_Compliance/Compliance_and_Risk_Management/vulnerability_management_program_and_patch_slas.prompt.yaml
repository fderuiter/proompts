      Draft a formal vulnerability management program policy that outlines the end-to-end process for identifying, classifying, prioritizing, and remediating security vulnerabilities. The policy must establish risk-based Service Level Agreements (SLAs) for patching based on CVSS severity scores (e.g., 14 days for Critical, 30 days for High). It should also specify the required tooling for vulnerability scanning, detail the exception handling process, and define the roles and responsibilities for remediation across infrastructure and product teams.
