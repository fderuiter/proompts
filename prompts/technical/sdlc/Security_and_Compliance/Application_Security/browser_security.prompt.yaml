      Establish a comprehensive browser security policy that mandates a defense-in-depth approach for all our front-end applications. The policy must require the implementation of: a strict Content Security Policy (CSP) to prevent XSS; Subresource Integrity (SRI) to validate third-party scripts; COOP/COEP headers to create a secure, cross-origin isolated context; and a Permissions-Policy header to explicitly disable sensitive browser features that are not required by the application.
