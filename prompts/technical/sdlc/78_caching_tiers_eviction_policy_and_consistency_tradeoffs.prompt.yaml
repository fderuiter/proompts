      Create an architectural guide on implementing a multi-tiered caching strategy to improve application performance and reduce database load.

      The guide should describe the purpose of different caching tiers, from client-side and CDN caching to in-memory distributed caches (like Redis or Memcached). It must analyze common eviction policies (e.g., LRU, LFU, TTL) and provide a clear framework for product teams to make intentional trade-offs between performance gains and data consistency by choosing the appropriate caching pattern (e.g., cache-aside, read-through, write-through).
