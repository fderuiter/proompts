      Outline a technical best-practices guide for database schema evolution that ensures zero downtime for our applications. The guide should detail a process for "online migrations" using patterns like expand-and-contract (or parallel change) to safely add, modify, and remove columns and tables without locking. Furthermore, describe how to implement automated guardrails within our CI/CD pipeline to detect and block potentially dangerous migrations, such as those that could cause data loss or require extended table locks, before they are ever deployed to production.
