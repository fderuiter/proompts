      Provide a detailed overview of the four key DORA (DevOps Research and Assessment) metrics: Deployment Frequency, Lead Time for Changes, Change Failure Rate, and Time to Restore Service. For each metric, explain what it measures, why it is a critical indicator of software delivery performance, and how a team can instrument its CI/CD pipeline and incident management tools to collect this data accurately. Conclude with a framework for how engineering leaders can use these metrics to identify areas for improvement and foster a culture of data-driven continuous improvement.
