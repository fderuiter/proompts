      Create a proposal for establishing a ResearchOps function to operationalize and scale our product discovery efforts. The proposal should define the core mission and services of ResearchOps, including managing participant recruitment and scheduling, maintaining a centralized insights repository, and standardizing research tools and templates. It must also recommend a sustainable, weekly cadence for continuous discovery habits (like user interviews and prototype testing) that product teams can adopt to ensure a constant flow of customer feedback informs their priorities.
