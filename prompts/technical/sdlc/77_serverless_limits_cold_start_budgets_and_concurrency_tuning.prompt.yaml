      Create a best-practices guide for engineers developing applications on our serverless platform (e.g., AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions). The guide should clearly document platform-specific limits (memory, timeout, package size) and provide actionable strategies for performance optimization. It must address how to mitigate and budget for cold starts on latency-sensitive functions and offer a decision framework for tuning concurrency settings (e.g., provisioned vs. on-demand) to strike the right balance between cost and performance.
