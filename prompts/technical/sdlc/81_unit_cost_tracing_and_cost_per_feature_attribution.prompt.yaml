      Propose a strategy and technical implementation plan for achieving fine-grained cloud cost visibility and attribution. The plan should describe how to enforce a consistent resource tagging policy and leverage observability data to trace unit costs (e.g., cost per customer, cost per API request). The end goal is to develop a model that can attribute infrastructure spending back to specific product features, providing the business with critical insights to inform pricing, optimization efforts, and future technology investments.
