      Create a step-by-step tutorial on conducting a value-stream mapping exercise for a typical software development lifecycle, from idea conception to production deployment. The guide should explain how to identify all the key process steps and, crucially, the wait times between them. Provide a clear formula and example for calculating flow efficiency (value-added time vs. total lead time) and explain how the resulting map can be used to identify bottlenecks, eliminate waste, and guide targeted process improvements for a faster, more predictable delivery pipeline.
