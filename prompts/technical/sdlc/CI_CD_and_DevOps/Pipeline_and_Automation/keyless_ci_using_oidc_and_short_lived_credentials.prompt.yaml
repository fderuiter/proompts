      Design a security architecture for our CI/CD platform that completely eliminates the use of long-lived static API keys and secrets. The design should leverage OpenID Connect (OIDC) to establish a trust relationship between our CI provider (e.g., GitHub Actions) and our cloud environments. Explain how this enables each CI/CD job to dynamically and automatically request narrowly scoped, short-lived access credentials, drastically improving our security posture by removing the risk of leaked secrets.
