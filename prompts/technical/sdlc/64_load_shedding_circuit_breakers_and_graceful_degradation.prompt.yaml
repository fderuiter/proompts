      Develop a resiliency engineering strategy that ensures our application remains stable and functional during periods of extreme load or partial system failure. Explain how to implement three key patterns: 1) Load shedding, to intelligently reject excess traffic at the edge before it overwhelms the system; 2) Circuit breakers, to prevent a single failing downstream service from causing cascading failures; and 3) Graceful degradation, where non-essential features (e.g., recommendations) are temporarily disabled to protect core user journeys (e.g., checkout).
