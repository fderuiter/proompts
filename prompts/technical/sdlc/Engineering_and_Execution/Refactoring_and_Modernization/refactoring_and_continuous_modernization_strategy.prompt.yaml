      Develop a formal strategy for continuous modernization that empowers teams to proactively manage technical debt. This strategy should advocate for allocating a consistent percentage of each team's capacity to refactoring and system improvements. Outline a process for identifying, prioritizing, and executing this work, suggesting metrics like code complexity, module churn, and business impact to guide decisions. The goal is to create a sustainable engineering culture that balances building new features with the essential work of keeping our codebase healthy, secure, and maintainable over the long term.
