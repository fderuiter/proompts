      Develop a strategic whitepaper that explains how our engineering organization can adopt the Team Topologies framework to improve software delivery and reduce cognitive load. Describe the four fundamental team types: stream-aligned, enabling, complicated subsystem, and platform. For each type, provide examples relevant to our business. Explain how to define team interaction modes (collaboration, X-as-a-Service, facilitating) and how this socio-technical approach helps align our organizational structure with our software architecture to create empowered teams with clear ownership and purpose.
