      Explain how to create a plan to modernize internet protocol usage. This involves ensuring systems can run on both the old (IPv4) and new (IPv6) internet protocols simultaneously, with a plan to eventually switch over. This is also known as an IPv6/DNSSEC dual-stack readiness and cutover plan. DNSSEC adds a layer of security to the domain name system.
