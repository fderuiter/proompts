# Refactor Existing Flask Repo Prompts

This series of prompts provides a structured, phased approach to refactoring and modernizing an existing Flask repository.

The process begins with a comprehensive audit of the repository to identify key areas for improvement. Subsequent prompts guide the agent through a series of targeted refactoring activities, including:
- Adopting the application factory pattern and 12-factor configuration.
- Modularizing the codebase into cohesive components with clear boundaries.
- Improving dependency management and hygiene.
- Establishing a baseline for testing, static analysis, and type checking.
- Implementing typed API schemas and validation.
- Hardening the database layer and introducing migrations.
- Adding support for background jobs and caching.
- Enhancing security, observability, and documentation.
- Improving the local development experience with Docker.
- Setting up a robust CI/CD pipeline.

Each prompt is a self-contained step that moves the repository towards a more modern, maintainable, and scalable architecture without changing existing behavior.
