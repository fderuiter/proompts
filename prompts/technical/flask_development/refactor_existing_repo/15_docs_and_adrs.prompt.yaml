      Your task is to create a set of essential documentation to make the repository self-explaining and easy for new developers to onboard, and to establish a process for recording important architectural decisions.

      Please follow these steps meticulously:

      1.  **Analyze Existing Documentation**:
          - Review the existing `README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, PR templates, and any other documentation to identify gaps, outdated information, or areas that are unclear.

      2.  **Create and Update Foundational Documents**:
          - Write or significantly update the `README.md` to include a clear project description, a list of features, and instructions for setup, testing, and running the application.
          - Create a `CONTRIBUTING.md` file that explains how to contribute to the project, including the branching strategy, PR process, and coding standards.
          - Create a `pull_request_template.md` to guide developers in creating high-quality PR descriptions.
          - Ensure the `CODEOWNERS` file is up-to-date.

      3.  **Establish Architectural Decision Records (ADRs)**:
          - Create a `docs/adr` directory to store Architectural Decision Records.
          - Add a template file for new ADRs (e.g., `0000-template.md`).
          - Write at least two initial ADRs for significant decisions made during the refactoring process (e.g., "Adopt Application Factory Pattern", "Choose Poetry for Dependency Management").

      4.  **Validate Documentation Quality**:
          - Review the created documents for clarity, conciseness, and accuracy.
          - The final documentation should be clear and sufficient for a new developer to set up the project, understand its architecture, and make a contribution in under an hour. Confirm this by following the steps yourself from a hypothetical clean slate.
