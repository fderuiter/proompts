# Flask Development Prompts

This directory contains prompts for developing and refactoring Flask applications. The prompts are designed to be used by an autonomous coding agent to perform complex development tasks.

The prompts are divided into two main categories:
- **new_project**: Prompts for bootstrapping a new, production-ready Flask application from scratch.
- **refactor_existing_repo**: Prompts for auditing and refactoring an existing Flask repository to improve its structure, quality, and maintainability.

It also includes `agent_tips.md` with specific instructions for the agent when working with these Flask prompts.
