      Your task is to create the initial set of documentation for the new Flask project to ensure it is easy to understand, contribute to, and maintain.

      Please follow these steps meticulously:

      1.  **Analyze Documentation Needs**:
          - Review the project structure and goals to identify the essential documentation needed for a new developer to get started.

      2.  **Create Foundational Documents**:
          - Write a `README.md` with a project overview and detailed instructions for the one-command setup (`make setup && make up`).
          - Write a `CONTRIBUTING.md` that outlines the development workflow, PR process, and code style guidelines.
          - Create a `pull_request_template.md` and a `CODEOWNERS` file.

      3.  **Establish Architectural Decision Records (ADRs)**:
          - Create a `docs/adr` directory with an ADR template (`0000-template.md`).
          - Write the first two ADRs for key initial decisions, such as "Choose Pydantic-Settings for Typed Configuration" and "Use Flask-Smorest for API Validation".

      4.  **Validate Documentation Quality**:
          - Review the created documents for clarity, conciseness, and accuracy.
          - The final documentation must be comprehensive enough for a new team member to get the project running and understand how to contribute without assistance. Confirm this by following the steps yourself from a hypothetical clean slate.
