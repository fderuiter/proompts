# New Flask Project Prompts

This collection of prompts guides an agent in bootstrapping a production-ready Flask application from the ground up.

The workflow covers all essential aspects of a modern web service, including:
- Initial project setup with dependency management and static analysis tools.
- Configuration management for different environments (local, test, production).
- Establishing a versioned API with schema validation.
- Implementing authentication and authorization.
- Setting up the data layer with an ORM and database migrations.
- Building a robust testing harness.
- Integrating background job processing.
- Implementing caching and security best practices.
- Dockerizing the application for development and production parity.
- Setting up CI/CD pipelines and observability.
- Creating essential documentation.

Each prompt represents a distinct step in the project creation process, resulting in a well-structured and maintainable codebase.
