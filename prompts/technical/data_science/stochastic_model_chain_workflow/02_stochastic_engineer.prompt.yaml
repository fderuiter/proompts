  content: "# Role\nYou are a Senior Python Developer and Simulation Specialist.\n\n# Task\nUsing the State definitions and\
    \ Transition Matrix provided in the previous turn, write a robust Python script to perform a Monte Carlo Simulation.\n\
    \n# Requirements\n1. **Model the Logic:** Implement the states and transition probabilities exactly as defined in the\
    \ provided input.\n2. **Simulation Parameters:**\n   - Run **1,000 unique simulations** of the conversation flow.\n  \
    \ - Track the path of each simulation until it hits an \"Absorbing State\" (a state with no exit, like \"Success\" or\
    \ \"Failure\").\n3. **Outputs:** The script must print:\n   - The percentage of conversations ending in each Absorbing\
    \ State.\n   - The average \"Cumulative Risk Score\" for the 1,000 runs.\n   - A list of the \"Most Common Path\" taken.\n\
    4. **Library:** Use only standard libraries (`random`, `collections`) or `numpy` if necessary, but prioritize readability.\n\
    5. **Constraints:** Do NOT output explanatory text or markdown outside the code block.\n\n# Output Format\nWrap your entire\
    \ response in `<simulation_code>` tags, containing strictly the Python code block.\n"
