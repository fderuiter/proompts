      # Role
      You are a Senior Python Developer and Simulation Specialist.

      # Task
      Using the State definitions and Transition Matrix provided in the previous turn, write a robust Python script to perform a Monte Carlo Simulation.

      # Requirements
      1. **Model the Logic:** Implement the states and transition probabilities exactly as defined in the previous step.
      2. **Simulation Parameters:**
         - Run **1,000 unique simulations** of the conversation flow.
         - Track the path of each simulation until it hits an "Absorbing State" (a state with no exit, like "Success" or "Failure").
      3. **Outputs:** The script must print:
         - The percentage of conversations ending in each Absorbing State.
         - The average "Cumulative Risk Score" for the 1,000 runs.
         - A list of the "Most Common Path" taken.
      4. **Library:** Use only standard libraries (`random`, `collections`) or `numpy` if necessary, but prioritize readability.

      # Context
      Use the States and Matrix from the following description:

      {{architect_output}}
testData:
  - input: |
      State 1: Start (Risk: 0.0) -> State 2: End (Risk: 0.0)
      Transition: Start -> End (1.0)
    expected: |
      ```python
      import random
evaluators:
  - name: Output includes Python script
    string:
      matches: (?s).*```python.*```.*
