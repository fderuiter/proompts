# Django Development Prompts

This directory contains a suite of prompts for performing common, best-practice development tasks for projects built with the Django framework. These prompts are designed to guide a coding agent through complex operations, ensuring consistency and high-quality outcomes.

The prompts cover the entire lifecycle of a modern web application, including:

-   **Project Initialization:** Bootstrapping a new project with production-grade standards.
-   **Refactoring:** Systematically improving the architecture of an existing codebase.
-   **Tooling & Hygiene:** Establishing and enforcing repository standards.
-   **Security:** Hardening settings and implementing security best practices.
-   **Testing:** Creating a robust and efficient testing strategy.
-   **API Design:** Building versioned and documented APIs with DRF.
-   **Performance:** Auditing and improving application performance with caching.
-   **Async Tasks:** Setting up background task processing with Celery.
-   **Observability:** Integrating tools for logging, monitoring, and error tracking.
-   **Containerization:** Creating a one-command local development environment with Docker.
-   **Documentation:** Establishing clear project documentation and decision records.
