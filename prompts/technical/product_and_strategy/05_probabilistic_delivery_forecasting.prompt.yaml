      Explain how to implement probabilistic delivery forecasting with Monte Carlo and lead-time distributions. Instead of giving a single, often inaccurate delivery date, this method uses historical data and statistical simulations (Monte Carlo method) to predict a range of likely completion dates with probabilities (e.g., "an 85% chance of finishing by Q3").
