# Asynchronous Agent Prompts

This directory contains prompts designed to be used by an asynchronous coding agent. These prompts help the agent manage complex, long-running tasks by providing structure for planning, communication, and error handling.

### Prompts

-   **01_task_decomposition.prompt.yaml:** Breaks down a high-level user request into a detailed, step-by-step plan.
-   **02_progress_update.prompt.yaml:** Generates a clear and concise progress update for the user.
-   **03_error_diagnosis_recovery.prompt.yaml:** Helps the agent diagnose and recover from errors encountered during a task.
