      Develop a comprehensive access management framework for our internal systems and cloud infrastructure. Compare and contrast Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) with Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC), and recommend a hybrid approach. The framework must incorporate the principles of Just-in-Time (JIT) access and Just-Enough-Administration (JEA) to grant temporary, scoped-down permissions. Finally, outline a mandatory, auditable process for periodic access reviews to ensure the principle of least privilege is consistently maintained and stale permissions are revoked.
