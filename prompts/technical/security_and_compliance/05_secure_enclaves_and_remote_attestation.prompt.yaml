      Author a technical whitepaper on using secure enclaves (e.g., Intel SGX, AWS Nitro Enclaves) to create a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) for our most sensitive data processing workloads. The paper should explain how enclaves provide hardware-level isolation for code and data, protecting it even from the host machine's administrator. It must also detail the cryptographic process of remote attestation, which allows a client to verify that it is communicating with authentic, unmodified code running within a genuine secure enclave before transmitting any sensitive data.
