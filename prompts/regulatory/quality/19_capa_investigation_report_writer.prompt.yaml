testData:
- input:
    incident_summary: 'Labeling machine X misprinted batch #123 with the wrong expiration date.'
    root_cause: The operator manually entered the date instead of scanning the work order barcode, leading to a typo.
    actions_taken: Updated the machine software to require barcode scanning; disabled manual entry for critical fields. Retrained
      all operators.
    effectiveness_check: Monitored the next 5 production runs; 100% of labels matched the work order.
