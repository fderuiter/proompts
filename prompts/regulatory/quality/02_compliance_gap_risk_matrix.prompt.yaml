  content: '1. Review each clause and cite exact paragraph numbers.

    1. Score gaps using a 1‑to‑5 Likelihood × Severity scale.

    1. Suggest a “Minimum Viable Mitigation” for any score ≥12.

    1. Output only the final matrix; avoid private reasoning.

    1. Ask clarifying questions if information is missing.


    Inputs:

    - `{{sops}}` — process SOP excerpts.

    - `{{known_nonconformities}}` — list of known issues.


    Output format:

    CSV‑ready table with columns: Clause, Finding, Likelihood, Severity, Risk Score, Mitigation, Owner, Target Date.


    Additional notes:

    This approach aligns with auditor workflows and supports import into GRC tools.
