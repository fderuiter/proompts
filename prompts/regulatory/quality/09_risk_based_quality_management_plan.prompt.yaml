      1. Specify roles, data sources, and review frequency.
      1. Outline the escalation and communication pathway.

      Inputs:
      - `{{study_overview}}` — summary of the Phase I trial.

      Output format:
      Numbered sections with a table for the risk matrix, written in plain language. Conclude with a paragraph explaining how the plan supports subject safety, data integrity, and inspection readiness.

      Additional notes:
