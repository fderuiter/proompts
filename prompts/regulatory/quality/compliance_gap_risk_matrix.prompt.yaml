    1. Review each clause and cite exact paragraph numbers.
    1. Score gaps using a 1‑to‑5 Likelihood × Severity scale.
    1. Suggest a “Minimum Viable Mitigation” for any score ≥12.
    1. Output only the final matrix; avoid private reasoning.
    1. Ask clarifying questions if information is missing.

    Inputs:
    - `{{sops}}` — process SOP excerpts.
    - `{{known_nonconformities}}` — list of known issues.

    Output format:
    CSV‑ready table with columns: Clause, Finding, Likelihood, Severity, Risk Score, Mitigation, Owner, Target Date.

    Additional notes:
    This approach aligns with auditor workflows and supports import into GRC tools.
