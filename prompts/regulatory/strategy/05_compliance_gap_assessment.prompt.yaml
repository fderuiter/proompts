  content: "1. Build a gap matrix comparing Appendix A controls to Appendix B evidence with columns:\n   - Control ID and\
    \ description.\n   - Status (Implemented, Partially, Missing).\n   - Severity if missing (High/Medium/Low).\n   - Recommended\
    \ remediation action and owner.\n1. Highlight the top five high‑impact gaps.\n1. Suggest quick‑win remediations achievable\
    \ within 30 days.\n1. Propose KPIs to track remediation progress quarterly.\n\nInputs:\n- `{{controls}}` — framework control\
    \ list.\n- `{{evidence_logs}}` — policies and evidence artifacts.\n\nOutput format:\n```json\n\n{\n  \"gapMatrix\": [\
    \ ... ],\n  \"summary\": {\n    \"topGaps\": [ ... ],\n    \"quickWins\": [ ... ],\n    \"recommendedKpis\": [ ... ]\n\
    \  }\n}\n```\n\nUse camelCase keys.\n\nAdditional notes:\nBase severity on likelihood × impact. If evidence is older than\
    \ 12 months, mark status as Partially implemented. Request missing artifacts before final scoring."
