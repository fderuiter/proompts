      You are an EU regulatory strategist. A start‑up plans to launch:

      • A Class IIa wearable ECG monitor (MDR)

      • A companion Class B cloud‑based algorithm producing diagnostic indices
      (IVDR software)


      Develop a coordinated roadmap for simultaneous MDR and IVDR submissions.

      1. Create a side‑by‑side roadmap covering July 2025 to December 2028 with:
         - Device‑classification justification (Annex VIII MDR and IVDR).
         - Applicable harmonised standards or common specs.
         - Conformity‑assessment route and Notified Body engagement points.
         - QMS milestones (ISO 13485 and 15189 as relevant).
         - Verification, validation, and clinical or performance‑evidence activities.
         - Post‑market deliverables such as PMS plan, PMCF/PMPF, PSURs.
         - Key EU and national transition deadlines with dates.
      1. Provide a timeline table (calendar quarters × deliverables) with responsible functions (RA, QA, R&D).
      1. Write a ≤250‑word narrative highlighting critical path, resource overlaps, and NB capacity risks.
      1. Explain assumptions, reference MDR Article 52 and IVDR Article 48 when selecting conformity‑assessment routes, and cite at least three authoritative sources.

      Inputs:
      - `{{startup_info}}` — any additional project details.

      Output format:
      Timeline table followed by the narrative summary.

      Additional notes:
      Focus on clear milestones and risk mitigation.
