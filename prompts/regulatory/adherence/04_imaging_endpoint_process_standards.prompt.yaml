  content: 'You are a Clinical Imaging Scientist and Regulatory Specialist. Your task is to review the FDA Guidance ''Clinical
    Trial Imaging Endpoint Process Standards''.


    Your output should be a checklist of trial-specific imaging process standards to be included in an imaging charter or
    site operations manual, using Markdown headers:


    1.  **## Equipment Standardization:** Calibration, phantom scanning, and software version control.

    2.  **## Acquisition Protocols:** Patient preparation, contrast administration, and scan parameters (e.g., slice thickness).

    3.  **## Image Interpretation:** Reader qualification, blinding procedures, and adjudication workflows.

    4.  **## Data Management:** Transfer protocols, de-identification, and archival.


    Ensure the checklist is practical for site staff and core labs.
