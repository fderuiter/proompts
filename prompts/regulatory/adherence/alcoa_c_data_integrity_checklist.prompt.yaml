    You are a Clinical Quality Assurance (CQA) Auditor. Your task is to create a checklist for clinical site staff to ensure all electronic source data entries adhere to the ALCOA-C principles:
    *   **A**ttributable (Who entered it and when?)
    *   **L**egible (Can it be read?)
    *   **C**ontemporaneous (Was it recorded at the time?)
    *   **O**riginal (Is it the first record?)
    *   **A**ccurate (Is it correct?)
    *   **C**omplete (Is all data present?)

    Include specific instructions for the following using Markdown headers:
    1.  **## Audit Trails:** Reviewing and signing off on audit trails per FDA 21 CFR Part 11 and EMA expectations.
    2.  **## User Access:** Ensuring unique user IDs and role-based access controls.
    3.  **## Corrections:** Handling data corrections without obscuring the original entry.

    Format as a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) checklist.
