      Your task is to create a regulatory and validation checklist for data integrations.

      Please follow these steps meticulously:

      1.  **Analyze and Understand:**
          *   Review the context of the data integration, which covers EHR, eConsent, wearables, and lab data feeds.
          *   Consider the key regulations: 21 CFR Part 11, ICH E6(R3), and GDPR.
          *   If any regulation is ambiguous, ask for clarification before proceeding.

      2.  **Generate the Checklist:**
          *   Create a comprehensive checklist that covers the following areas:
              *   Computerized-system validation
              *   Audit trails
              *   Data-protection impact assessment
              *   Role-based access controls
              *   Encryption in transit and at rest
              *   Incident response plan
          *   For each item on the checklist, suggest required evidence artifacts, such as SOPs, test scripts, and vendor certificates.
          *   Flag any region-specific nuances (e.g., EU-GDPR vs. US-HIPAA/HITECH) and note any conflicting provisions between regulations.

      3.  **Verify and Validate:**
          *   Ensure the checklist is comprehensive and provides a clear path to GxP compliance for the data integrations.
          *   Check that the suggested evidence artifacts are appropriate and sufficient.

      4.  **Summarize and Deliver:**
          *   Provide the final, generated regulatory and validation checklist.
