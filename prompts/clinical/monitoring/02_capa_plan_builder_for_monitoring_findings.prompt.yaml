      Your task is to build a CAPA plan for monitoring findings.

      Please follow these steps meticulously:

      1.  **Analyze and Understand:**
          *   Review the provided monitoring findings (`{{input}}`).
          *   For each finding, perform a brief root-cause analysis.

      2.  **Generate the CAPA Plan:**
          *   For each root cause, define one specific Corrective Action and one specific Preventive Action.
          *   Assign a responsible party, a due date, and an effectiveness-check metric for each action.
          *   Present the entire plan in a Markdown table with the following columns: `Issue | Root Cause | Corrective Action | Preventive Action | Owner | Due Date | Effectiveness Check`.
          *   Follow the table with a one-paragraph summary of the plan.

      3.  **Verify and Validate:**
          *   Ensure the tone of the plan is forward-looking and aligns with institutional CAPA templates.
          *   Check that the actions are specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART).

      4.  **Summarize and Deliver:**
          *   Provide the final, generated CAPA plan. Do not show your chain-of-thought.
