      2. Define one **Corrective Action** and one **Preventive Action** per root cause.
      3. Assign a responsible party, due date, and effectiveness-check metric.
      4. Present the plan in a markdown table with columns `Issue | Root Cause | Corrective Action | Preventive Action | Owner | Due Date | Effectiveness Check`.
      5. Ensure tone is forward-looking and aligns with institutional CAPA templates.

         **Reasoning**: Think step-by-step, do not reveal your internal reasoning.
