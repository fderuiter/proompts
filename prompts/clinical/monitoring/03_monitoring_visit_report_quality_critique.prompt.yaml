      Your task is to perform a quality critique of a Monitoring Visit Report (MVR).

      Please follow these steps meticulously:

      1.  **Analyze and Understand:**
          *   Review the provided draft MVR (`{{input}}`).
          *   Use the following checklist for your review: protocol adherence, IP accountability, source-CRF reconciliation, AE/SAE reporting, action-items follow-up, signature status, and overall tone.

      2.  **Generate the Critique:**
          *   Flag any omissions or vague language in the report. For each issue, quote the section header and suggest a precise revision.
          *   Highlight any findings that require escalation to a Corrective and Preventive Action (CAPA).
          *   Organize your feedback into two blocks:
              1.  A "Summary of Critical Gaps" as a bulleted list (max 200 words).
              2.  A "Line-by-Line Redlines" section in a Markdown table with the columns: `Section | Current Text | Recommended Edit`.

      3.  **Verify and Validate:**
          *   Ensure your critique is thorough and covers all items in the checklist.
          *   Check that the suggested revisions are clear, precise, and professional.

      4.  **Summarize and Deliver:**
          *   Provide the final, generated MVR quality critique. Do not show your chain-of-thought.
