      Your task is to perform a quality audit of a Case Report Form (CRF).

      Please follow these steps meticulously:

      1.  **Analyze and Understand:**
          *   Review the provided CRF (`{{input}}`).
          *   Evaluate it against the standards of CDISC CDASH IG v2.1 and SDTM traceability.
          *   Think step-by-step through the potential issues before generating your response.

      2.  **Generate the Audit Findings:**
          *   Check for common issues such as duplicated fields, ambiguous wording, inconsistent units, uncontrolled text boxes, and mis-aligned visit windows.
          *   For each issue found, suggest a concrete fix and cite the relevant guideline section.
          *   Present your findings in a two-column Markdown table with the columns "Issue" and "Recommended Fix".
          *   After the table, summarize the overall risk level of the CRF as low, moderate, or high.

      3.  **Verify and Validate:**
          *   Ensure the audit is thorough and the recommended fixes are practical and compliant.
          *   Check that the output format (table and risk level) is correct.

      4.  **Summarize and Deliver:**
          *   Provide the final, generated CRF quality audit report.
