      Your task is to build a risk matrix for a decentralized trial.

      Please follow these steps meticulously:

      1.  **Analyze and Understand:**
          *   Review the user's request and any provided information about the decentralized trial.
          *   Identify potential risk areas specific to decentralized trials (e.g., remote patient monitoring, data privacy, device management).

      2.  **Generate the Risk Matrix:**
          *   For each identified risk, assess its likelihood and impact.
          *   Propose specific mitigation strategies to reduce the risk.
          *   Assign a residual risk level (Low, Medium, High) after mitigation.
          *   Organize the findings into a structured risk matrix table.

      3.  **Verify and Validate:**
          *   Ensure the risk assessment is comprehensive and the mitigation strategies are practical.
          *   Check that the risk matrix is clear and easy to understand.

      4.  **Summarize and Deliver:**
          *   Provide the final, generated risk matrix.
