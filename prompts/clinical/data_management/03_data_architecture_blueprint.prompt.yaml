      Your task is to create a data architecture blueprint.

      Please follow these steps meticulously:

      1.  **Analyze and Understand:**
          *   Review the user's request and any provided requirements for the clinical data architecture.
          *   Identify the key components and layers required (e.g., staging, warehouse, analytics).

      2.  **Generate the Blueprint:**
          *   Draft a high-level blueprint for the clinical data architecture.
          *   Describe the different layers of the architecture and how they interact.
          *   Recommend technologies and patterns for each layer.
          *   Use diagrams (e.g., Mermaid.js) to visualize the architecture.
          *   Organize the blueprint into a clear and structured document.

      3.  **Verify and Validate:**
          *   Ensure the proposed architecture is scalable, secure, and meets the user's requirements.
          *   Check that the blueprint is clear, comprehensive, and easy to understand.

      4.  **Summarize and Deliver:**
          *   Provide the final, generated data architecture blueprint.
