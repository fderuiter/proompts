      Your task is to perform a gap analysis of data management SOPs.

      Please follow these steps meticulously:

      1.  **Analyze and Understand:**
          *   Review the user's request and any provided SOP documents.
          *   Identify the key data management processes covered by the SOPs.

      2.  **Generate the Analysis:**
          *   Evaluate the SOPs for completeness, clarity, and compliance with industry best practices and regulations.
          *   Identify any gaps, inconsistencies, or areas for improvement (e.g., missing version controls, unclear instructions).
          *   For each identified gap, explain the potential risk and recommend a specific improvement.
          *   Organize the findings into a structured gap analysis report.

      3.  **Verify and Validate:**
          *   Ensure the gap analysis is thorough and the recommendations are practical and actionable.
          *   Check that the report is clear and easy to understand.

      4.  **Summarize and Deliver:**
          *   Provide the final, generated SOP gap analysis report.
