      Your task is to build a tailored feasibility questionnaire.

      Please follow these steps meticulously:

      1.  **Analyze and Understand:**
          *   Review the provided protocol summary (`{{protocol_summary}}`).
          *   If key details are missing from the summary, list them and stop.

      2.  **Generate the Questionnaire:**
          *   Create a questionnaire with the following sections, adhering to the question limits for each:
              *   **Section A – Patient Population** (max 8 questions)
              *   **Section B – Facilities & Equipment** (max 6 questions)
              *   **Section C – Staffing & Experience** (max 6 questions)
              *   **Section D – Regulatory & Budget** (max 5 questions)
              *   **Section E – Open-ended Risk Questions** (max 3 questions)
          *   Phrase each question to elicit a quantitative answer where possible.
          *   Present the final output as a numbered list of questions under each section heading.

      3.  **Verify and Validate:**
          *   Ensure the questions are clear, concise, and relevant to assessing site feasibility.
          *   Check that all medical acronyms are consistent with the protocol summary.

      4.  **Summarize and Deliver:**
          *   Provide the final, generated feasibility questionnaire.
