      Your task is to generate a personalized investigator outreach email.

      Please follow these steps meticulously:

      1.  **Analyze and Understand:**
          *   Review all the provided variables: `{{investigator_name}}`, `{{site_name}}`, `{{city_country}}`, `{{recent_relevant_trials}}`, `{{unique_site_strength}}`, `{{study_synopsis}}`, and `{{sponsor_name}}`.
          *   If any variable is blank, ask for the missing information before proceeding.

      2.  **Generate the Email:**
          *   Draft a professional and collaborative email between 180 and 220 words.
          *   Open with a site-specific hook that references the investigator's recent work.
          *   Summarize the study's value proposition and explain why the investigator's patient mix is a good alignment.
          *   Briefly explain the CRO support that will be provided (e.g., rapid start-up, dedicated CTAs).
          *   Close with a clear call-to-action that links to a 15-minute introductory call.
          *   Format the final output as a JSON object with `subject_line` and `email_body` fields.

      3.  **Verify and Validate:**
          *   Ensure the email tone is professional and collaborative.
          *   Check that the email is within the specified word count and contains all the required components.
          *   Verify that the output is a valid JSON object.

      4.  **Summarize and Deliver:**
          *   Provide the final, generated JSON object containing the email.
