      Your task is to create an FDA MDR/MDV adverse-event narrative.

      Please follow these steps meticulously:

      1.  **Analyze and Understand:**
          *   Review the provided event data (`{{input}}`), extracting the event date, patient age/sex, device identifiers, and reporter type.

      2.  **Generate the Narrative:**
          *   Write a concise, chronological narrative of 1200 characters or less.
          *   The narrative must describe the circumstances of the event and the impact on the patient.
          *   It must state whether the device malfunctioned and if it was returned for analysis.
          *   It must include any relevant concomitant products or procedures.
          *   The narrative must end with the exact boilerplate sentence: "This information is submitted to comply with 21 CFR 803.52."

      3.  **Verify and Validate:**
          *   Ensure the narrative is accurate, concise, and contains all the required information.
          *   Check that the character limit is respected and the boilerplate sentence is included verbatim.

      4.  **Summarize and Deliver:**
          *   Provide the final, generated adverse-event narrative.
