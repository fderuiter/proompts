      Your task is to perform a protocol review and gap analysis.

      Please follow these steps meticulously:

      1.  **Analyze and Understand:**
          *   Review the provided clinical trial protocol (`{{protocol_text_or_nct}}`).

      2.  **Generate the Review:**
          *   Score the protocol on a scale of 1-5 for each of the following areas:
              a. Patient Burden & Recruitment Feasibility
              b. Site Operational Complexity
              c. Data Quality & Endpoint Clarity
              d. Regulatory Completeness
          *   Present these scores in a table with a one-line rationale for each score.
          *   For any area that scores below a 4, provide a bulleted list of specific, evidence-based changes, citing the relevant section numbers from the protocol.
          *   Write a short "quick-win" paragraph summarizing the top three most actionable improvements.

      3.  **Verify and Validate:**
          *   Ensure your feedback is constructive and references best practice guidelines.
          *   Check that the scoring is justified and the recommendations are clear and specific.

      4.  **Summarize and Deliver:**
          *   Provide the final, generated protocol review.
