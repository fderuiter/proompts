      Your task is to refine a protocol's eligibility criteria section.

      Please follow these steps meticulously:

      1.  **Analyze and Understand:**
          *   Review the provided draft section (`{{draft_section}}`) and the target condition (`{{condition}}`).
          *   Consider the requirements of Good Clinical Data Management Practices (GCDMP), Trial Master File (TMF) standards, and 21 CFR Part 11.

      2.  **Generate the Refined Section:**
          *   Rewrite the section to include specific inclusion and exclusion rules (e.g., sample type, analyte range, comorbidities).
          *   Describe the chain-of-custody and sample-handling procedures required to ensure integrity and audit readiness.
          *   Ensure the language is concise and aligns with regulatory expectations.
          *   Format the revised section in Markdown with clear subsections for the criteria and handling procedures.

      3.  **Verify and Validate:**
          *   Check that the refined section is compliant with the specified data management and TMF standards.
          *   Ensure the criteria and procedures are clear, specific, and unambiguous.

      4.  **Summarize and Deliver:**
          *   Provide the final, generated, refined protocol section.
