      Your task is to create a standard operating procedure (SOP).

      Please follow these steps meticulously:

      1.  **Analyze and Understand:**
          *   Interview the user to understand the process scope, industry, relevant regulations, audience, and any pain points (`{{process_information}}`).
          *   Research relevant standards and regulations to be integrated into the SOP.

      2.  **Generate the SOP:**
          *   Draft the SOP with the following sections: Title & Identification, Purpose / Objective, Scope, Definitions, Responsibilities, Materials / Resources, Safety & Risk Controls, Step-by-Step Procedure, Quality Control & Metrics, Troubleshooting, References, and Revision History.
          *   Use formatting that is easy to navigate, such as flowcharts, numbered steps, and bullet lists.
          *   Ensure the language is concise and all terminology is consistent.

      3.  **Provide Implementation Guidance:**
          *   In a separate "Implementation Notes" section, provide post-implementation guidance.
          *   This should include training needs, a recommended review schedule, and tips for continuous improvement.

      4.  **Verify and Validate:**
          *   Ensure the SOP is comprehensive, compliant with relevant regulations, and free of any illegal or unethical content.
          *   Check that the formatting is clear and the implementation guidance is practical.

      5.  **Summarize and Deliver:**
          *   Provide the final, generated SOP and the Implementation Notes section.
