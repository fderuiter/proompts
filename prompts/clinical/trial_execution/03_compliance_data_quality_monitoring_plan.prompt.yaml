      Your task is to create a compliance and data quality monitoring plan.

      Please follow these steps meticulously:

      1.  **Analyze and Understand:**
          *   Review the trial's risk profile to tailor the monitoring plan accordingly.
          *   Consider the requirements for maintaining GCP/GCDMP compliance, enabling early detection of data anomalies, and ensuring timely resolution of protocol deviations.

      2.  **Generate the Monitoring Plan:**
          *   **Part A:** Create a list of automated alert types and their specific trigger conditions.
          *   **Part B:** Specify the frequency of human-AI reviews, including who should be involved and how often they should occur.
          *   **Part C:** Define the reporting cadence to sponsors and regulators, including the frequency, content, and recipients of the reports.
          *   Organize the final plan into three clear Markdown sections as specified above.

      3.  **Verify and Validate:**
          *   Ensure the plan is comprehensive and provides a robust framework for monitoring compliance and data quality.
          *   Check that the alert triggers, review schedules, and reporting plans are clear and actionable.

      4.  **Summarize and Deliver:**
          *   Provide the final, generated compliance and data quality monitoring plan.
