      Your task is to create a portfolio-level clinical operations roadmap.

      Please follow these steps meticulously:

      1.  **Analyze and Understand:**
          *   Review the context of managing 12 active Phase I-III trials across oncology and rare-disease portfolios.
          *   Keep in mind the target KPIs: ≤ 10% protocol deviation rate, first-patient-in cycle ≤ 45 days, and on-budget variance ≤ 5%.
          *   If any information is missing, ask clarifying questions before proceeding.

      2.  **Generate the Roadmap:**
          *   Outline quarterly milestones for the portfolio in a timeline view.
          *   Develop a detailed resourcing plan, including required FTEs and key vendors, with cost estimates.
          *   For each quarter, specify three leading risk indicators and their corresponding mitigation triggers.
          *   Suggest several "quick-win" actions that can be achieved in 30 days or less to demonstrate early progress.
          *   Format the final output with an "Executive Summary" (150 words or less) and a "Detailed Roadmap" in a Markdown table.

      3.  **Verify and Validate:**
          *   Ensure the roadmap is tailored to achieve the stated KPIs.
          *   Check that the resourcing plan and risk indicators are realistic and comprehensive.

      4.  **Summarize and Deliver:**
          *   Provide the final, generated clinical operations roadmap.
