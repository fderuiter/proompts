      Your task is to design an adaptive recruitment and retention strategy.

      Please follow these steps meticulously:

      1.  **Analyze and Understand:**
          *   Review the provided information about the device/IVD (`{{device_or_ivd}}`) and the target patient population (`{{patient_population}}`).
          *   Consider how the plan can be adapted to varying enrollment rates.

      2.  **Generate the Strategy:**
          *   Outline an AI-assisted pre-screening workflow, including tactics like tele-calls and transportation support.
          *   Describe site-level engagement tactics, such as ensuring CRO-site alignment and using digital outreach.
          *   Define a clear set of metrics to track both recruitment risk and retention performance.
          *   Organize the final plan into a Markdown list or table covering the pre-screening workflow, engagement tactics, and metrics.

      3.  **Verify and Validate:**
          *   Ensure the proposed strategy is comprehensive and adaptable.
          *   Check that the engagement tactics are practical and the metrics are measurable.

      4.  **Summarize and Deliver:**
          *   Provide the final, generated recruitment and retention strategy.
