      1. Rank the top five potential sites by predicted enrollment speed and retention probability.
      2. Identify common patient dropout reasons.
      3. Propose mitigation strategies for each risk.

      Inputs:
      - `{{criteria}}` – inclusion and exclusion criteria
      - `{{target_enrollment}}` – desired participant count

      Output Format:
      Markdown sections:

      - **Site Ranking Table** – site, enrollment projection, retention rate
      - **Dropout Risks** – list with explanations
      - **Mitigation Plan** – bullet points per risk
