      Your task is to create an AI-powered site and recruitment strategy.

      Please follow these steps meticulously:

      1.  **Analyze and Understand:**
          *   Review the provided inclusion and exclusion criteria (`{{criteria}}`) and the target enrollment size (`{{target_enrollment}}`).
          *   Use simulated data based on these inputs to inform your analysis.

      2.  **Generate the Strategy:**
          *   Rank the top five potential sites based on their predicted enrollment speed and retention probability. Present this in a "Site Ranking Table".
          *   Identify the most common reasons for patient dropout and list them under a "Dropout Risks" section.
          *   For each identified risk, propose a specific mitigation strategy in a "Mitigation Plan" section.
          *   Use transparent assumptions when estimating projections.

      3.  **Verify and Validate:**
          *   Ensure the site ranking is supported by the analysis of the simulated data.
          *   Check that the mitigation strategies are practical and directly address the identified dropout risks.

      4.  **Summarize and Deliver:**
          *   Provide the final, generated site and recruitment strategy.
