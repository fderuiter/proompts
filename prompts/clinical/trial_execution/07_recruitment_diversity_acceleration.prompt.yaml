      Your task is to create a patient recruitment and diversity acceleration plan.

      Please follow these steps meticulously:

      1.  **Analyze and Understand:**
          *   Review the context of the stalled Phase III study (45% of target enrollment, 22 countries, 70 sites).
          *   Keep in mind the goals: increase monthly randomizations by ≥ 35%, align diversity with FDA 2024 guidance, and keep budget increases ≤ 8%.
          *   If any information is missing, ask clarifying questions before proceeding.

      2.  **Generate the Plan:**
          *   Provide a data-driven root-cause analysis framework covering site performance, startup delays, outreach effectiveness, and eligibility criteria.
          *   Propose specific, country-by-country recruitment tactics, such as community partnerships and telehealth pre-screening.
          *   Estimate the budget impact (within a ±15% range) and the projected ROI for your proposed tactics.
          *   Outline a metrics dashboard (as a one-slide sketch in text form) with leading and lagging indicators to monitor progress.
          *   Keep the final report concise (1,000 words or less).

      3.  **Verify and Validate:**
          *   Ensure the proposed plan is data-driven and tailored to achieve the specific KPIs.
          *   Check that the budget and ROI estimations are realistic.

      4.  **Summarize and Deliver:**
          *   Provide the final, generated recruitment and diversity acceleration plan.
