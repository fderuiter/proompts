      Your task is to create a risk-based monitoring and quality plan.

      Please follow these steps meticulously:

      1.  **Analyze and Understand:**
          *   Review the context of the Phase II oncology trial (340 patients, multi-region, on-site and decentralized elements).
          *   Identify the top 10 critical-to-quality factors for this trial.
          *   Map each factor to relevant regulations like ICH-E6(R3) and FDA draft guidance.

      2.  **Generate the Plan:**
          *   Create a risk register in a Markdown table. For each critical-to-quality factor, assign a risk score and specify detection and mitigation strategies (e.g., central statistical monitoring, triggered visits).
          *   Outline an escalation workflow and a communication matrix for handling identified risks.
          *   Recommend digital tools and metrics to track risk in real time.
          *   Create an executive slide outline (in bullet points) summarizing the plan.

      3.  **Verify and Validate:**
          *   Ensure the plan is comprehensive and compliant with GCP standards.
          *   Check that the risk register, workflows, and recommendations are clear and actionable.

      4.  **Summarize and Deliver:**
          *   Provide the final, generated risk-based monitoring and quality plan, including the executive outline and risk register.
