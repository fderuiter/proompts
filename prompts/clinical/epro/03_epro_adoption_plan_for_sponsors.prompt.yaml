      Your task is to create an ePRO adoption plan for sponsors.

      Please follow these steps meticulously:

      1.  **Analyze and Understand:**
          *   Review the sponsor's needs for implementing ePRO across five global sites, including device strategy, integration, training, and metrics.

      2.  **Generate the Adoption Plan:**
          *   Provide a detailed timeline with milestones for vendor selection, UAT, IRB approval, and training.
          *   List the key criteria for choosing between a BYOD (Bring Your Own Device) and a provisioned device strategy.
          *   Detail the coordination steps required for integrating the ePRO solution with EDC/IWRS and for reconciling data.
          *   Summarize the necessary patient training materials and the components of a site support guide.
          *   Recommend specific metrics to monitor (e.g., compliance rate, missing data, time-to-entry) and explain how to use them for iterative improvement.
          *   Highlight potential risks, such as varying site readiness or device availability.

      3.  **Verify and Validate:**
          *   Ensure the plan is comprehensive, actionable, and covers all the sponsor's needs.
          *   Check that the proposed timeline and recommendations are realistic.

      4.  **Summarize and Deliver:**
          *   Provide the final, generated ePRO adoption plan.
