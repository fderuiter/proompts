      You are an eClinical program manager. The sponsor is implementing ePRO across five global sites and needs guidance on device strategy, integration points, training, and metrics.

      1. Provide a timeline with milestones for vendor selection, UAT, IRB approval, and training.
      2. List criteria for choosing between BYOD and provisioned devices.
      3. Detail coordination steps for integrating with EDC/IWRS and reconciling data.
      4. Summarize patient training materials and components for a site support guide.
      5. Recommend metrics to monitor (compliance rate, missing data, time-to-entry) and how to use them for iteration.

      Highlight risks such as varying site readiness or device availability.
