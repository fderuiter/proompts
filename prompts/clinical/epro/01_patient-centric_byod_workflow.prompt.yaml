      Your task is to design a patient-centric BYOD ePRO workflow.

      Please follow these steps meticulously:

      1.  **Analyze and Understand:**
          *   Review the requirements for the Phase II trial, including the need for IWRS integration, training guides, automated reminders, and data validation.
          *   Confirm any assumptions about platform capabilities or security requirements (HIPAA, GDPR) before finalizing the workflow.

      2.  **Generate the Workflow Design:**
          *   List the key setup steps for implementing a BYOD ePRO solution.
          *   Provide a mock screen flow and outline UX best practices to ensure ease of use for patients.
          *   Describe the integration checkpoints with the IWRS and any other data systems.
          *   Outline the measures to ensure patient data is secure, compliant with HIPAA and GDPR, and fully auditable.

      3.  **Verify and Validate:**
          *   Ensure the designed workflow is comprehensive and addresses all stated requirements.
          *   Check that the proposed security measures are robust and compliant.

      4.  **Summarize and Deliver:**
          *   Provide the final, generated workflow design document.
