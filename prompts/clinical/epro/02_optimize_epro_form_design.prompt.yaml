      Your task is to optimize an ePRO form design.

      Please follow these steps meticulously:

      1.  **Analyze and Understand:**
          *   Review the existing ePRO form, which contains 20 items for symptom tracking.
          *   Focus on the goals of clarity, ease of use, and data accuracy to maximize patient compliance.

      2.  **Generate the Optimized Design:**
          *   Propose a simplified design that groups or splits questions into digestible screens (with a maximum of three questions per screen).
          *   Incorporate logic for mandatory responses, including an "intentionally skip" option, range checks, and clear error prompts.
          *   Suggest onboarding content, such as screenshots and tooltips, to guide the user.
          *   Describe a mechanism for users to review and edit their prior responses before final submission.
          *   Explain how real-time validation and avoiding default responses will improve data quality.

      3.  **Verify and Validate:**
          *   Ensure the proposed design is user-centric and addresses the goal of minimizing respondent burden.
          *   Check that all specified design elements (question grouping, validation logic, etc.) are included.

      4.  **Summarize and Deliver:**
          *   Provide the final, generated ePRO form design document.
