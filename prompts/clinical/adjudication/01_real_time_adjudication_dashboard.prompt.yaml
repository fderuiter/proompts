      Your task is to design a real-time adjudication visibility dashboard.

      Please follow these steps meticulously:

      1.  **Analyze and Understand:**
          *   Review the context of the Phase III cardiovascular device study and the need for immediate insight into blocked events.
          *   If any requirements are unclear, ask for clarification before proceeding.

      2.  **Generate the Dashboard Design:**
          *   Draft a textual workflow diagram illustrating the process from site submission to the final CEC decision.
          *   Define the minimal data model required for a role-based dashboard, including fields for event aging, disagreement rate, missing document percentages, and adjudicator workload.
          *   List five automated alerts or reminders that could help reduce turnaround time.
          *   Recommend two commercial or open-source eAdjudication platforms and provide a justification for your choice.
          *   Organize the final design into four sections: Workflow Diagram, Dashboard Data Model, Alert Rules, and Platform Recommendations.

      3.  **Verify and Validate:**
          *   Ensure the proposed design provides the required real-time visibility for stakeholders.
          *   Check that the data model is sufficient and the recommendations are practical.

      4.  **Summarize and Deliver:**
          *   Provide the final, generated dashboard design document.
