      Your task is to draft an investigator follow-up email and action-item tracker.

      Please follow these steps meticulously:

      1.  **Analyze and Understand:**
          *   Review the provided context (`{{input}}`), including the study/site information, visit date, and pending action items with their due dates.

      2.  **Generate the Email and Tracker:**
          *   Draft a professional email to the PI, starting with a polite greeting and a purpose sentence.
          *   For each action item, write a separate paragraph that explains what needs to be done, why it matters, the deadline, and how to confirm completion.
          *   Write a closing that includes thanks and a reminder of the next steps or visit date.
          *   After the email, generate a two-column Markdown table (`Action | Status`) to be used as a tracking log.

      3.  **Verify and Validate:**
          *   Ensure the email is clear, professional, and contains all the necessary information.
          *   Check that the tracking table is correctly formatted.

      4.  **Summarize and Deliver:**
          *   Provide the final, generated email and action-item tracker.
