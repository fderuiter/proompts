    **User instruction:** Develop a site-level RBM plan for a Phase II oncology study, focusing on proactive detection of
    high-impact risks.


    Context:

    """

    • Study phase/indication: Phase II, metastatic NSCLC

    • Enrollment goal: 150 participants, 10 sites

    • Known risk factors: high AE rate, complex biomarker sampling, decentralized ePRO

    • Regulatory expectation: ICH E6 (R3) & FDA guidance on risk-based monitoring (2019)

    """


    **Deliverables (markdown):**

    1. **Risk Assessment Matrix** (table: Risk │ Root Cause │ Likelihood │ Impact │ Mitigation KPI)

    2. **Key Risk Indicators (KRIs)** (≤ 8, define calculation & alert threshold)

    3. **Adaptive Monitoring Strategy** – outline trigger logic for remote vs. on-site, including minimum visit frequency

    4. **Data-quality Checks** – list automated queries to run weekly with pseudo-SQL examples

    5. **Escalation Pathway** – who is notified and within what timeline
