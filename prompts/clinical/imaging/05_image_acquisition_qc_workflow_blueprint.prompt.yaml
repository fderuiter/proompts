      lab management system (ICTMS).


      - Study description: `<<<study_description>>>`

      - Modalities: MRI (3 T) and low-dose CT

      - Sites involved: 30

      - Standards: ISO 13485 documentation controls and decentralized-trial elements
      such as remote upload and eConsent


      1. Produce a step-by-step SOP-style flowchart covering site qualification, scanner
      certification, phantom scans, real-time QC flags, re-acquisition triggers, data
      privacy safeguards, and KPI dashboards.

      2. Present the flowchart as indented text with no more than 12 steps.

      3. Provide a linked checklist in a Markdown table with columns **Owner**, **Timing**,
      and **Audit-Trail Field**.

      4. Bold any automated ICTMS step.

      5. Ask clarifying questions if needed.


      Focus on practical steps that sites can follow.'
