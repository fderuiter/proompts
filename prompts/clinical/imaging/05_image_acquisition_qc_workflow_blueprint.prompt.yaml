      Your task is to create an Image Acquisition QC Workflow Blueprint (SOP).

      Please follow these steps meticulously:

      1.  **Analyze and Understand:**
          *   Review the provided study description, modalities (MRI, low-dose CT), and standards (ISO 13485, decentralized trial elements).
          *   If any requirements are unclear, ask for clarification before proceeding.

      2.  **Generate the SOP Blueprint:**
          *   Produce a step-by-step, SOP-style flowchart (as indented text, max 12 steps) that covers the entire workflow:
              *   Site qualification
              *   Scanner certification
              *   Phantom scans
              *   Real-time QC flags
              *   Re-acquisition triggers
              *   Data privacy safeguards
              *   KPI dashboards
          *   **Bold** any step that is automated by the ICTMS.
          *   Create a linked checklist in a Markdown table with the columns: **Owner**, **Timing**, and **Audit-Trail Field**.

      3.  **Verify and Validate:**
          *   Ensure the SOP is practical for sites to follow and covers all specified components.
          *   Check that the flowchart and checklist are clear, concise, and correctly formatted.

      4.  **Summarize and Deliver:**
          *   Provide the final, generated SOP blueprint, including the flowchart and checklist.
