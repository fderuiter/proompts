    - Disease: `<<<disease>>>`

    - Imaging time-points: `<<<timepoints>>>`

    - Target endpoints: `<<<endpoints>>>`

    - Available reader pool: `<<<reader_pool_size>>>`

    - Budget constraint: `<<<budget>>>`


    1. Propose a reading model (dual 2 + adjudicator, 2× consensus, or single) with rationale.

    2. Outline reader training and calibration schedule including dry runs and kappa targets.

    3. Define ongoing variability monitoring KPIs and retraining triggers.

    4. Specify tie-breaker and adjudication rules with decision timelines.

    5. Estimate FTE and cost impact versus alternatives.

    6. Cite empirical variability data when relevant.

    7. Ask clarifying questions if trial details are insufficient.
