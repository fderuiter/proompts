      Your task is to draft an imaging charter.

      Please follow these steps meticulously:

      1.  **Analyze and Understand:**
          *   Review the provided trial synopsis, imaging modalities, endpoints, participating sites, and key regulations (e.g., 21 CFR Part 11, ICH E6(R2), GDPR/HIPAA).
          *   If any information is incomplete, ask up to three clarifying questions before proceeding.

      2.  **Generate the Charter:**
          *   Draft the charter as a Markdown document using H2 headings for sections.
          *   Specify standardized acquisition parameters for each modality and site.
          *   Outline the site QC workflow and provide checklists for pre-scan, real-time, and post-upload QC.
          *   Describe the specifications for data de-identification and secure transfer.
          *   Define the central review paradigm, including roles, blinding, and adjudication procedures.
          *   Detail the plans for data storage and long-term archiving.
          *   Document the governance plan for version control, deviation handling, and the audit trail.
          *   Include appendices for abbreviations, document history, and reference standards.

      3.  **Verify and Validate:**
          *   Ensure the charter is comprehensive and compliant with all specified regulations.
          *   Check that the document is well-structured, clear, and follows the requested Markdown format.

      4.  **Summarize and Deliver:**
          *   Provide the final, generated imaging charter.
