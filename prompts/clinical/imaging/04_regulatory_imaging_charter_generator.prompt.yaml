      Your task is to generate a regulatory-compliant imaging charter.

      Please follow these steps meticulously:

      1.  **Analyze and Understand:**
          *   Review the provided trial synopsis, imaging modalities, endpoints, participating regions, and key regulations (e.g., FDA "Clinical-Trial Imaging Endpoint Process Standards", ISO 14155).
          *   If any information is incomplete, ask clarifying questions before proceeding.

      2.  **Generate the Charter:**
          *   Draft a comprehensive imaging charter in Markdown with the following H2 sections:
              *   Trial Overview
              *   Image-Acquisition Protocols (including scanner settings, contrast, patient prep)
              *   QC Plan
              *   Blinded-Read Design (including reader qualification and calibration)
              *   Data Management and Transfer
              *   Adjudication Workflow
              *   Risk-Mitigation Matrix
              *   Version-Control Log
          *   Use concise bullet lists within each section.
          *   Highlight any mandatory regulatory citations in *italic*.
          *   Conclude the document with a one-page executive summary.

      3.  **Verify and Validate:**
          *   Ensure the charter is comprehensive and strictly adheres to the specified regulatory standards and language.
          *   Check that all required sections and formatting (H2 headings, italics, executive summary) are present.

      4.  **Summarize and Deliver:**
          *   Provide the final, generated imaging charter.
