      Your task is to perform QC on site uploads and generate queries.

      Please follow these steps meticulously:

      1.  **Analyze and Understand:**
          *   Review the provided daily upload log CSV (`<<<upload_log.csv>>>`).
          *   The CSV contains the columns: `Site_ID`, `Subject_ID`, `Visit`, `Modality`, `SeriesUID`, `Upload_Timestamp`, `QC_Flag`, and `QC_Notes`.
          *   If the schema differs, ask for the correct column names before proceeding.

      2.  **Perform the Analysis and Draft Queries:**
          *   Parse the file and identify all rows where the `QC_Flag` is not "pass".
          *   For each Site_ID, summarize the counts of "warn" and "fail" flags and list the top three recurring issues from the `QC_Notes`.
          *   Draft a standardized email template to be sent to each site with issues. The email should list the affected subjects/visits, describe each issue in plain language, and request corrective action or a re-upload by a specific deadline.
          *   Flag any systemic issues where 25% or more of a site's uploads have failed.
          *   Format the final output as a JSON object containing a `summary_table` and an `emails` object with the drafted site communications.

      3.  **Verify and Validate:**
          *   Ensure the analysis of QC flags and common issues is accurate.
          *   Check that the drafted email templates are clear, professional, and contain all necessary information.
          *   Verify that the output is a valid JSON object in the specified format.

      4.  **Summarize and Deliver:**
          *   Provide the final, generated JSON object containing the QC summary and site queries.
