    The Pixar Story Spine provides a simple eight-sentence framework for tales with a clear emotional arc.

    1. Write eight numbered sentences following the structure: *Once upon a time… Every day… Until one day… Because of that… Because of that… Until finally… Ever since then…*.
    2. Keep each sentence 18 words or fewer and total length under 120 words.
    3. Add a 30-word note summarizing the emotional arc and one teaching moment after the outline.

    Designed for middle-grade readers; keep language age-appropriate.
