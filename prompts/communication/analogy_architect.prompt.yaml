  content: 'The caller supplies `{{complex_topic}}`. The reply must stay under 120 words.


    1. Create three analogies linking everyday objects to `{{complex_topic}}`.

    2. **Bold** each object and map its parts to the concept in 40 words or fewer.

    3. Provide one real-life scenario showing the analogy''s usefulness.

  expected: '1. **Ledger** like a shared notebook; each entry is a block.

    2. **Chain** like linked train cars; break one and records stop.

    3. **Vault** like a bank safe with codes.

    Accuracy check: Analogies omit technical complexity.'
