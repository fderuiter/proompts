      Draft a memo to the CEO and Board explaining 'Technical Debt' using a financial analogy suitable for non-technical stakeholders.
      * **Metaphor:** Use the concept of 'high-interest credit cards' vs. 'strategic mortgages.'
      * **The Ask:** Justify why we need to allocate <refactoring_percentage>{{refactoring_percentage}}</refactoring_percentage> of our sprint capacity to refactoring (paying down principal) to avoid a 'velocity crash' in <timeframe>{{timeframe}}</timeframe>.
