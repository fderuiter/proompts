      We need a solution for <function>{{function}}</function>. I am debating building it in-house vs. buying a solution like <vendor>{{vendor}}</vendor>.
      * **Task:** Create a weighted decision matrix.
      * **Variables:** Rate based on Total Cost of Ownership (TCO), Customizability, Time-to-Market, and Security Compliance.
      * **Outcome:** Provide a recommendation assuming our engineering team is currently at <team_capacity>{{team_capacity}}</team_capacity> capacity.
