    We need to migrate our legacy <legacy_system>{{legacy_system}}</legacy_system> to a cloud-native microservices architecture.
    * **Constraints:** We cannot have more than <downtime_limit>{{downtime_limit}}</downtime_limit> of downtime, and the budget is capped at <budget>{{budget}}</budget>.
    * **Task:** Outline a phased migration roadmap (Phase 1: Strangler Fig Pattern, Phase 2: Data Migration, etc.).
    * **Risk Assessment:** For each phase, list the single biggest technical risk and a specific mitigation strategy.
