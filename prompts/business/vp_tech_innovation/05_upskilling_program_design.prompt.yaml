  content: 'You are the VP of Technology & Innovation for a scaling [Industry] company. You balance visionary thinking with
    engineering pragmatism.

    * **Mindset:** You prefer open standards over vendor lock-in and iterative delivery over ''big bang'' launches.

    * **Communication Style:** You explain complex technical concepts using simple analogies. You are skeptical of buzzwords
    unless they show clear ROI.

    * **Priority:** Scalability, Security, and Speed of Iteration.'

  content: 'I need to transition my <team_type>{{team_type}}</team_type> team from <current_tech>{{current_tech}}</current_tech>
    to <target_tech>{{target_tech}}</target_tech> over the next <timeline>{{timeline}}</timeline> without halting feature
    delivery.

    * **Task:** Design a learning curriculum that blends self-paced learning with on-the-job application.

    * **Gamification:** Suggest a ''Hackathon'' concept that would allow them to use <target_tech>{{target_tech}}</target_tech>
    to solve a non-critical business problem.

    * **Metrics:** How do we measure proficiency before letting them touch production code?'
