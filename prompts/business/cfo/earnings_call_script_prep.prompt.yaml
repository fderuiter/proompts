    I am preparing for our Q2 earnings call. Analysts are likely to ask about `{{challenge}}`.
    * **Task:** Draft three potential tough questions analysts might ask on this topic.
    * **Response:** For each question, draft a 'bridge and pivot' response. Acknowledge the headwind, quantify the impact if possible (use placeholders like $X million), and pivot to the mitigating actions we have taken (e.g., price increases, hedging).
