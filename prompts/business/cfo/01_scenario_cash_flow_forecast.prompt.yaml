      Your task is to create a scenario-based clinical-trial cash-flow forecast.

      Please follow these steps meticulously:

      1.  **Analyze and Understand:**
          *   Review the provided baseline quarterly revenue, baseline quarterly costs, starting cash, and any notes on assumptions or upcoming events.

      2.  **Generate the Forecast:**
          *   Model a 12-quarter cash-flow forecast under three distinct scenarios:
              1.  **Base:** Using the provided baseline figures.
              2.  **Inflation:** With a +15% increase in cost inflation.
              3.  **Slow-Recruitment:** With a -20% patient-recruitment pace (you may need to model its impact on revenue/costs).
          *   Create a Markdown table that shows the net and ending cash for all three scenarios over the 12 quarters.
          *   Provide two bullet-point insights on potential liquidity risks or funding needs identified from the forecast.

      3.  **Verify and Validate:**
          *   Ensure the cash-flow calculations for each scenario are accurate.
          *   Check that the output format (table and insights) is correct.

      4.  **Summarize and Deliver:**
          *   Provide the final, generated forecast, starting with the title "**Scenario Forecast -**".
