      Your task is to create a target segment and user needs assessment.

      Please follow these steps meticulously:

      1.  **Analyze and Understand:**
          *   Review the specified device/assay and its clinical application.
          *   Gather information on potential user segments.

      2.  **Generate the Assessment:**
          *   For each user segment, describe their demographics, purchase behavior, and pain points.
          *   Highlight any unmet needs or "jobs to be done" for each segment.
          *   Suggest potential innovations that could address these unmet needs.
          *   Rank the segments by their potential market impact, including quotes or paraphrased statements from users where possible.
          *   Organize the final assessment as a ranked segmentation table with insights.

      3.  **Verify and Validate:**
          *   Ensure the analysis is insightful and focused on market impact and the user's voice.
          *   Check that the output format (ranked table with insights) is correct.

      4.  **Summarize and Deliver:**
          *   Provide the final, generated assessment.
