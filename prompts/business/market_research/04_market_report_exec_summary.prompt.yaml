      Your task is to create and refine an executive summary for the provided market report.

      Please follow these steps meticulously:

      1.  **Analyze and Draft:**
          *   Review the provided market report.
          *   Produce a first-pass summary of the report in 150 words or less.

      2.  **Critique and Refine:**
          *   Critically evaluate your own draft summary in no more than 75 words, focusing on its clarity, insights, and any potential bias.
          *   Rewrite the summary completely, fixing every issue you identified. Mark any additions to the new version **in bold**.
          *   Conclude with a 12-word reflection on what changed between the first and second drafts.

      3.  **Verify and Validate:**
          *   Ensure the final summary is accurate and reflects the key points of the original report.
          *   Check that the output is formatted correctly with numbered headings for "1. Initial Summary", "2. Critique", and "3. Final Summary".

      4.  **Summarize and Deliver:**
          *   Provide the final output containing all three sections (Initial Summary, Critique, and Final Summary).
