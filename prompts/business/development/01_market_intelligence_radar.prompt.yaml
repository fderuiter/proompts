      Your task is to create a market-intelligence radar to identify potential partners.

      Please follow these steps meticulously:

      1.  **Analyze and Understand:**
          *   Review the provided preferences for therapeutic areas, geography, company size, and data sources.
          *   Gather information from public funding databases, conference attendee lists, and press releases.

      2.  **Generate the Radar:**
          *   Score potential partners on a scale of 0-100 using the following weighted factors: market attractiveness (30%), strategic fit (30%), funding strength (20%), and partnership likelihood (20%).
          *   Present the results in a Markdown table, sorted by the total score.
          *   For the top three companies, provide a summary of your rationale (up to 150 words) and suggest a next-step outreach idea for each.

      3.  **Verify and Validate:**
          *   Ensure the scoring is consistent and based on the available data.
          *   Check that the output format (table and summary) is correct.

      4.  **Summarize and Deliver:**
          *   Provide the final, generated market-intelligence radar.
