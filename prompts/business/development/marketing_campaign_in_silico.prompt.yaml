    **Context:**
    We are selling a new suite of "{{service_suite_name}}" to {{target_audience}}.
    **Pain Points:**
    {{pain_points}}

    **Source Material (Features):**
    {{features}}

    **Task:**
    Create a **Marketing Asset Package** comprising the following three elements:

    1. **The "Hook" (Landing Page Hero Section):**
       * A bold Headline that grabs attention (focus on saving money/time).
       * A Sub-headline that explains the concept simply.
       * 3 Bullet points highlighting the benefits, not just features.

    2. **The "Pain-Agitate-Solution" Email Sequence:**
       * Draft a cold email to a {{target_audience}}.
       * *Pain:* Mention the high cost of protocol amendments and screen failures.
       * *Agitate:* Highlight the risk of a Phase 3 failure after years of investment.
       * *Solution:* Introduce our "{{service_suite_name}}" as the insurance policy they need.

    3. **The "One-Pager" Sell Sheet Copy:**
       * Create a section called "Why Simulate?"
       * Translate the features into benefits (e.g., ethical/financial benefits for SCA, operational benefits for Protocol Stress-Testing).
