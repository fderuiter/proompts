      Your task is to build a rapid proposal for the client.

      Please follow these steps meticulously:

      1.  **Analyze and Understand:**
          *   Review the client's needs and our CRO's capabilities, particularly in GLP toxicology and Phase I services.

      2.  **Generate the Proposal:**
          *   Produce a persuasive executive summary of 120 words or less.
          *   List our CRO's differentiators in bullet form (max 20 words each).
          *   Outline the proposed study design with sub-headers for Study Objectives, Key Assays, and a text-based Gantt timeline.
          *   Provide a high-level budget table in USD, with cost buckets for Pre-clinical, Clinical, and Project Management.
          *   Suggest two optional accelerator offerings (e.g., biomarker assay panel, eSource setup).
          *   Conclude with a clear call to action.

      3.  **Verify and Validate:**
          *   Ensure the entire document is 2,000 words or less and formatted in clean Markdown.
          *   Check that the tone is persuasive and emphasizes our efficiency.

      4.  **Summarize and Deliver:**
          *   Provide the final, generated proposal.
