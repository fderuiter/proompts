      [Source A: ICON 2024 Annual Report] ICON plc reported full-year 2024 revenue of $8.2 billion. Their pre-clinical breadth is limited compared to peers, focusing more on late-stage. They have a massive footprint in Europe (45 labs) and Asia (30 labs). Key digital tool: "ICONIK" for decentralized trials. Specialty assays include flow cytometry.
      [Source B: Labcorp Investor Presentation Q4 2024] Labcorp Drug Development (Covance) achieved $15.0 billion revenue in 2024. They are the market leader in specialty assays and diagnostics. Global footprint spans 100+ countries. Digital enablement is powered by "Labcorp Link". Pre-clinical services are extensive but consolidating.
      [Source C: Charles River Labs Press Release Jan 2025] Charles River Labs (CRL) announced 2024 revenue of $4.1 billion. They remain the dominant player in pre-clinical breadth and early-stage toxicology. Geographic footprint is strong in North America but growing in China. Digital tools: "Apollo" platform for microbial solutions.
