      My organization is a Clinical Research Organization (CRO) looking to launch a new service line called "In Silico Clinical Services." We want to move upstream in the drug development process, selling "feasibility and simulation" services to Pharma sponsors before they ever recruit a live patient.

      * **Synthetic Control Arms (SCA):** Replacing/augmenting placebo groups with historical data and Real-World Evidence (RWE) to reduce costs and ethical issues.
      * **Protocol Stress-Testing:** Using agent-based modeling to simulate the trial. We predict bottlenecks (e.g., complex visit schedules causing dropouts) and optimize inclusion/exclusion criteria.
      * **Digital Twin Modeling:** Virtual physiological models for precision medicine to predict efficacy and refine the target demographic.

      **Output Format:**
      Structure the response with the following Markdown headers (do not number them):

      - `## Executive Summary`
         - A high-level pitch on why the industry is shifting from "physical-first" to "simulation-first" trial design.
      - `## Detailed Service Breakdown`
         - For each concept, include:
           - *The Problem:* Specific pain point (e.g., high failure rates).
           - *The Solution:* How our service addresses it.
           - *The ROI:* Estimated financial or time impact.
      - `## SWOT Analysis`
         - Analyze Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats (consider FDA/EMA regulatory acceptance).
      - `## Target Client Profile`
         - Define the buyer (e.g., CMO at Biotech, VP Clinical Ops at Big Pharma).
      - `## Implementation Roadmap`
         - High-level view of technology/data partnerships needed.

        We are "OncoSim Solutions," a niche CRO specializing in Precision Oncology. We want to launch "Virtual Tumor Board" simulations.
        Our goal is to help biotech startups model drug interactions with specific tumor mutations before Phase I.
      source_material: |
        * **Genomic Data Integration:** Using TCGA and proprietary datasets to model tumor heterogeneity.
        * **In Silico Pharmacokinetics:** Predicting drug toxicity in patients with liver/kidney comorbidities using virtual physiological organs.
        * **Regulatory Pre-validation:** Generating synthetic data sets to support IND applications for rare cancer subtypes where patient recruitment is impossible.
    expected: A strategic plan focusing on Oncology, Genomic Data, and toxicity prediction.
