  required: true
  default: |
    My organization is a Clinical Research Organization (CRO) looking to launch a new service line called "In Silico Clinical Services." We want to move upstream in the drug development process, selling "feasibility and simulation" services to Pharma sponsors before they ever recruit a live patient.

    * **Synthetic Control Arms (SCA):** Replacing/augmenting placebo groups with historical data and Real-World Evidence (RWE) to reduce costs and ethical issues.
    * **Protocol Stress-Testing:** Using agent-based modeling to simulate the trial. We predict bottlenecks (e.g., complex visit schedules causing dropouts) and optimize inclusion/exclusion criteria.
    * **Digital Twin Modeling:** Virtual physiological models for precision medicine to predict efficacy and refine the target demographic.

    **Context:**
    {{organization_context}}

    **Source Material:**
    {{source_material}}

    **Task:**
    Draft a comprehensive **New Venture Strategic Plan** for this service line. The output must include:

    1. **Executive Summary:** A high-level pitch on why the industry is shifting from "physical-first" to "simulation-first" trial design.
    2. **Detailed Service Breakdown:** For each of the concepts in the source material, provide:
       * *The Problem:* What specific pain point does this solve for a Pharma Sponsor? (e.g., high failure rates, recruitment delays).
       * *The Solution:* How our service addresses it.
       * *The ROI:* Estimate the financial or time impact (e.g., "Reducing Phase 2 duration by X months").
    3. **SWOT Analysis:** Analyze the Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats of offering these specific AI services (consider FDA/EMA regulatory acceptance as a major factor).
    4. **Target Client Profile:** Define who buys this. Is it the Chief Medical Officer at a Biotech? The VP of Clinical Ops at Big Pharma?
    5. **Implementation Roadmap:** A high-level view of what technology or data partnerships we would need to build these capabilities.
