      Your task is to generate an RFP executive summary.

      Please follow these steps meticulously:

      1.  **Analyze and Understand:**
          *   Review the provided RFP synopsis for the global randomized Phase III NASH trial.
          *   Identify the sponsor's top three pain points.

      2.  **Generate the Executive Summary:**
          *   Draft an executive summary of 300 words or less that directly addresses the sponsor's pain points.
          *   Highlight five key CRO differentiators (e.g., tech stack, recruitment speed, risk-sharing pricing).
          *   Quantify at least two proof points to support your claims (e.g., average site-activation time).
          *   Close the summary with a clear next step and contact line.
          *   Maintain a confident, board-level tone supported by evidence.

      3.  **Verify and Validate:**
          *   Ensure the summary is persuasive and directly addresses the RFP.
          *   Check that all constraints (word count, number of differentiators/proof points) are met.

      4.  **Summarize and Deliver:**
          *   Provide the final, generated executive summary as a single Markdown section.
