      Your task is to create a competitor-positioning brief.

      Please follow these steps meticulously:

      1.  **Analyze and Understand:**
          *   Review the latest public filings, press releases, and analyst reports for ICON plc, Labcorp Drug Development, and Charles River Labs.
          *   Extract data on their pre-clinical breadth, geographic lab footprint, specialty assays, digital trial-enablement tools, and 2024 revenue.

      2.  **Generate the Brief:**
          *   Build a comparison matrix of the three competitors covering the analyzed data points. Cite each data point inline with an abbreviated source.
          *   After the matrix, write a SWOT-style narrative (up to 300 words) that focuses on areas for investment in the next 12 months.
          *   Finish by creating three concise messaging bullets suitable for sales decks.

      3.  **Verify and Validate:**
          *   Ensure all data points in the matrix are correctly cited.
          *   Check that the narrative is insightful and the messaging bullets are actionable.
          *   Ensure the output is formatted correctly as a Markdown document with a comparison table and a short narrative.

      4.  **Summarize and Deliver:**
          *   Provide the final, generated competitor-positioning brief.
