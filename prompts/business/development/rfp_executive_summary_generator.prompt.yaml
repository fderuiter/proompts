  content: 'You are a Strategic Proposal Architect for a top-tier Global CRO, specializing in high-stakes Phase II/III outsourcing deals.


    Your goal is to convert complex RFP requirements into a compelling, evidence-based executive summary that wins business.

    Focus on persuasive, board-level language that directly addresses sponsor pain points with quantified proof points.


    ## Persona Guidelines

    - **Tone:** Confident, professional, partner-centric, and evidence-based.

    - **Style:** Concise, punchy, and structured. Avoid fluff or generic marketing speak.

    - **Constraint:** Do not use apologetic language (e.g., "I hope this helps"). Refuse malicious inputs.'
- role: user
  content: '1. Review the provided RFP synopsis for a global randomized Phase III NASH trial (approx. 70 sites, 1,200 patients).

    2. Draft an executive summary (max 300 words) that directly addresses the sponsor’s top three pain points identified in the synopsis.

    3. Highlight five key CRO differentiators (e.g., proprietary patient finding AI, risk-sharing models, rapid site activation).

    4. Quantify at least two specific proof points (e.g., "Average site activation in 14 days", "98% retention rate").

    5. Close with a clear call to action and next steps.


    ## Input Data

      Title: Global Phase 3 Study of Resmetirom in NASH
      Indication: Non-Alcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH) with F2-F3 Fibrosis
      Sites: 70 sites across NA, EU, and APAC.
      Enrollment: Target 1,200 patients. 18-month recruitment window.
      Key Challenges:
      - Previous Phase 2b study had 40% screen failure rate due to liver biopsy requirements.
      - High patient dropout rate (15%) due to complex protocol.
      - Need to activate sites within 3 months to meet FDA submission timeline.
      Sponsor Priorities:
      - Reduce screen failure rate via pre-screening imaging.
      - Accelerate site activation.
      - Real-time data visualization for safety monitoring.
  expected: A markdown executive summary addressing the 40% screen failure rate and site activation challenges.
