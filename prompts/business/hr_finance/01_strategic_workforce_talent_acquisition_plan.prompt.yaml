      Your task is to generate a strategic workforce and talent acquisition plan.

      Please follow these steps meticulously:

      1.  **Analyze and Understand:**
          *   Review the provided headcount data (role breakdown, trial timelines, turnover rates) and salary benchmarks.
          *   If any data is missing or ambiguous, ask for clarification before proceeding.

      2.  **Generate the Plan:**
          *   Parse the data to identify staffing gaps by quarter.
          *   For each identified gap, suggest sourcing channels, a target time-to-hire, and a compensation range.
          *   Recommend retention levers for any roles that are hard to fill.
          *   Flag any risks to the plan and propose mitigation actions.
          *   Organize the final plan into a Markdown table (one row per role) and a 200-word executive summary.

      3.  **Verify and Validate:**
          *   Ensure the analysis of staffing gaps is accurate based on the data provided.
          *   Check that the recommendations are logical and the output format is correct.

      4.  **Summarize and Deliver:**
          *   Provide the final, generated plan in the requested format.
