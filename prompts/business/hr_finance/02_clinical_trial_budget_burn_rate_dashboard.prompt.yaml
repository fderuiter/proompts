      Your task is to generate a clinical trial budget and burn-rate dashboard.

      Please follow these steps meticulously:

      1.  **Analyze and Understand:**
          *   Review the provided data sources: staffing hours, invoices, milestone payments, and planned budgets from Google Sheets.
          *   Clean and join the data sets to prepare them for analysis.

      2.  **Generate the Dashboard:**
          *   For each study, calculate the cumulative spend and the burn rate in USD per week.
          *   Forecast the dates when the actual spend will reach 90% and 100% of the planned budget.
          *   Highlight any variances of 10% or greater.
          *   Suggest corrective levers for significant variances (e.g., renegotiating vendor rates, reducing CRA travel).
          *   Organize the final results into a Markdown table and up to five bullet-point recommendations, keeping the response under 300 words.

      3.  **Verify and Validate:**
          *   Double-check all calculations (spend, burn rate, forecasts, variances) for accuracy.
          *   Ensure the output format (table, recommendations) matches the user's request.

      4.  **Summarize and Deliver:**
          *   Provide only the final, generated dashboard and recommendations without showing your reasoning steps.
