      Your task is to generate a training compliance risk report.

      Please follow these steps meticulously:

      1.  **Analyze and Understand:**
          *   Review the provided training records (CSV of staff training dates by role and study).
          *   Note that GCP training requires a refresh every 24 months and GDPR every 12 months.
          *   If any data is missing or ambiguous, request clarification before proceeding.

      2.  **Generate the Report:**
          *   Identify individuals and department percentages that are past due for training or due within the next 30 days.
          *   Quantify a risk score from 0 to 100 for each study, based on the percentage of non-compliant staff.
          *   Recommend prioritized remedial actions for non-compliant staff, such as e-learning, live workshops, or escalation.
          *   Organize the final results into two tables (department-level compliance summary and study-level risk scores) and a narrative summary of up to 250 words for the COO.

      3.  **Verify and Validate:**
          *   Ensure all calculations (percentages, risk scores) are accurate.
          *   Check that the report format matches the user's request and maintains a factual, audit-ready tone.

      4.  **Summarize and Deliver:**
          *   Provide only the final, generated report without showing your reasoning steps.
