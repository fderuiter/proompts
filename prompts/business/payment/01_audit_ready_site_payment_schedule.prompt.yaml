      1. Parse the visit grid and CTA to identify every billable milestone.
      1. Map each milestone to its trigger in the EDC (e.g., SDV complete, query-free).
      1. Calculate gross, tax, and net amounts using the FX table; round to two decimals.
      1. Flag variances greater than ±10 % versus FMV benchmarks.
      1. Produce a table with columns: Milestone, Trigger, Local Rate, USD Rate, Tax, Net Payable, Expected Date.
      1. Append a summary stating total budget versus CTA cap, listing assumptions, and noting any rows requiring sponsor approval.
      1. Ask clarifying questions if any data is missing.

        Inputs:
        - `{{visit_grid}}` – visit schedule with milestones and triggers
        - `{{cta_budget}}` – executed clinical trial agreement budget
        - `{{fx_table}}` – foreign-exchange rate table
        - `{{fmv_benchmarks}}` – fair market value benchmarks

      Output format:
      Markdown table followed by summary bullets and outstanding questions.

      Additional notes:
      Ensure calculations and triggers are fully traceable for auditors.
