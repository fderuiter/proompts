      Your task is to create a payment process risk assessment and mitigation plan.

      Please follow these steps meticulously:

      1.  **Analyze and Understand:**
          *   Review the provided description of the current workflow, the KPI metrics, and the technology stack.
          *   If any workflow details are missing, ask for clarification before proceeding.

      2.  **Generate the Assessment and Plan:**
          *   Identify and list the top five accuracy or transparency risks and their root causes.
          *   For each risk, recommend one or two mitigations based on industry best practices (e.g., automated disbursements, real-time dashboards).
          *   Prioritize the recommended mitigations using a RICE or effort-vs-impact matrix.
          *   Outline a 90-day implementation roadmap with checkpoints and metrics, using bullet lists and a text-based Gantt-style schedule.

      3.  **Verify and Validate:**
          *   Ensure the risk assessment is thorough and the proposed mitigations are practical and relevant.
          *   Check that the output format (bullet lists, roadmap table) is correct.

      4.  **Summarize and Deliver:**
          *   Provide the final, generated risk assessment and mitigation plan.
