      Your task is to create a global regulatory and tax matrix for site payments.

      Please follow these steps meticulously:

      1.  **Analyze and Understand:**
          *   Review any provided regional guidelines and your own knowledge base for the specified regions.
          *   If any requirements are ambiguous, ask for clarification before proceeding.

      2.  **Generate the Matrix:**
          *   Create a Markdown table with the following columns: `Region`, `Timing Rule`, `Mandatory Reports`, `Tax Docs`, `FX/Banking Notes`, `Record Retention`, and `Recent Updates (≤ 12 months)`.
          *   Populate the table with concise information, referencing official guidance where possible.
          *   Provide a short commentary (≤150 words) on emerging trends, such as heightened scrutiny of cross-border payments.

      3.  **Verify and Validate:**
          *   Ensure the information in the matrix is accurate and up-to-date.
          *   Check that the output format (table and commentary) is correct.

      4.  **Summarize and Deliver:**
          *   Provide the final, generated matrix and commentary.
