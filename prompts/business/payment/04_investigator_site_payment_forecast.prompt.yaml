      Your task is to create an investigator-site payment forecast.

      Please follow these steps meticulously:

      1.  **Analyze and Understand:**
          *   Review the provided site data, enrollment curve, and FX rate sheet.
          *   Clarify any assumptions before starting.

      2.  **Generate the Forecast:**
          *   Convert all milestone amounts to USD using the provided FX rates.
          *   Build a Markdown table showing monthly and cumulative payment totals, both per site and overall.
          *   In the table, highlight any month with a greater than 20% variance compared to the previous forecast in **red**.
          *   Write a short narrative summary of the key forecast drivers, such as seasonality or enrollment ramp-up.

      3.  **Verify and Validate:**
          *   Ensure all calculations (USD conversions, totals, variances) are accurate.
          *   Check that the output format (table and narrative) is correct and the table is easy to import into spreadsheets.

      4.  **Summarize and Deliver:**
          *   Provide the final, generated forecast.
