# Google Jules Prompts

This directory contains prompts specifically optimized for Google Jules, an autonomous coding agent. These prompts are designed to leverage Jules' strengths in multi-file operations, systematic testing, and batch processing, while providing clear boundaries and structured execution plans.

## Key Features
*   **Interactive Planning Mode:** Requires Jules to output a plan before execution.
*   **Strict File Targeting:** Explicitly defines read-only and write-only scopes.
*   **Verification Loops:** Mandates running tests to verify changes.
