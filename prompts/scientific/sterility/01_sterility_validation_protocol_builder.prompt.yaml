  content: '- Define worst-case product configuration and family grouping approach.

    - Design bioburden assessment, fractional/half-cycle verification, and VDmax method per **ISO 11137‑1:2025** and **ISO 11737‑2:2019**.

    - Calculate sample sizes and acceptance criteria to meet a PNSU ≤ 10^-6.

    - Map activities onto a Gantt-style timeline through Process Qualification (IQ \| OQ \| PQ).

    - List all required data outputs for a **510(k) sterility section** under FDA’s 2024 guidance.


    Inputs:

    - `{{device_description}}` – instrument details.


    Output format:

    Numbered sections: Overview, Materials, Methods, Acceptance Criteria, Timeline, and References.


    Additional notes:

    - Include all equations explicitly.

    - Cite each standard or guidance section by clause number.

    - Think through the solution step-by-step internally and reveal only the final protocol.'
