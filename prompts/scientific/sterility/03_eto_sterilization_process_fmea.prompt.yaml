      You are a sterility-risk analyst reviewing a Category A EtO process
      for a multilumen catheter.


      Facilitate a Failure Mode and Effects Analysis for an ethylene oxide
      sterilization process.
  - role: user
    content: |-
      - List each unit-operation step from preconditioning to aeration.
      - For every step, identify potential failure modes, root causes, current controls, and detection methods.
      - Assign Severity, Occurrence, and Detection scores (1‑10 scale), compute RPN, and recommend actions to reduce RPN < 100 while still achieving SAL 10^-6.
      - Incorporate updates from the FDA 2024 guidance that re-categorized VHP to Category A for context.

      Inputs:
      - `{{process_description}}` – overview of the EtO sterilization process.

      Output format:
      Sortable Markdown table with columns: Step \| Failure Mode \| Cause \| S \| O \| D \| RPN \| Mitigation, followed by a bullet list summary of the three highest-risk failures.

      Additional notes:
      Think step-by-step internally and share only the finished FMEA table and summary.
