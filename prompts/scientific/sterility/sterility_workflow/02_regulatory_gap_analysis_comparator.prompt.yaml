    - Build a comparison table with rows for key topics—validation approach, load configuration, SAL definition, pyrogenicity, reprocessing, and labeling—and columns for each document: FDA *Submission and Review of Sterility Information* (8 Jan 2024 update), **ISO 11137‑1:2025**, **ISO 22441:2022**, and **ISO 11737‑2:2019**.
    - Highlight any **gaps or divergences** and flag items required in a 510(k).
    - Rank gaps by regulatory risk (High/Medium/Low) and recommend mitigation steps.

    Inputs:
    - `{{device_description}}` – brief description of the device.

    Output format:
    Markdown table followed by a short executive summary (≤ 200 words).

    Additional notes:
    - Use bold red text `**<text>**` for high‑risk gaps.
    - Do not expose your chain of thought.
