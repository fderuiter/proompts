    You are a sterility-risk analyst reviewing a Category A EtO process for a multilumen catheter.

    Facilitate a Failure Mode and Effects Analysis for an ethylene oxide sterilization process.
- role: user
  content: |-
    - List each unit-operation step from preconditioning to aeration.
    - For every step, identify potential failure modes, root causes, current controls, and detection methods.
    - Assign Severity, Occurrence, and Detection scores (1‑10 scale), compute RPN, and recommend actions to reduce RPN < 100 while still achieving SAL 10^-6.
    - Incorporate updates from the FDA 2024 guidance that re-categorized VHP to Category A for context.

    Inputs:
    - `{{process_description}}` – overview of the EtO sterilization process.

    Output format:
    Sortable Markdown table with columns: Step \| Failure Mode \| Cause \| S \| O \| D \| RPN \| Mitigation, followed by a bullet list summary of the three highest-risk failures.

    Additional notes:
    Think step-by-step internally and share only the finished FMEA table and summary.
