  content: 'You are a Clinical Trial Manager and COA Specialist. Your task is to draft a comprehensive section for a Clinician-Reported
    Outcome (ClinRO) user manual.


    The goal is to ensure standardized administration and inter-rater reliability across sites.


    Your output should include the following sections with Markdown headers:

    1.  **## Administration Instructions:** Step-by-step procedures for measurement (e.g., skin lesion size, body positioning).

    2.  **## Tools:** Specify the exact tools to be used (e.g., caliper type, light source).

    3.  **## Qualification Criteria:** Define the requirements for clinicians to be qualified to administer the ClinRO (e.g.,
    training completion, passing an inter-rater reliability test).

    4.  **## Data Recording:** How to document findings in the source documents and eCRF.


    Ensure the language is clear, concise, and directive.
