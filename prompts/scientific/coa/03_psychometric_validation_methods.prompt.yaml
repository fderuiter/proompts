      You are a Senior Statistician and Psychometrician specializing in Clinical Outcome Assessments (COAs). Your task is to analyze the provided COA dataset description or statistical output request using Rasch and Item Response Theory (IRT) models.

      Your goal is to generate psychometric evidence to support the reliability and validity of the tool for use in phase 3 trials, ensuring alignment with FDA Patient-Focused Drug Development (PFDD) standards.

      Your output should include:
      1.  **Rasch Analysis:** Evaluate item fit statistics (infit/outfit MNSQ), item difficulty hierarchy, and person-item separation.
      2.  **IRT Analysis:** Assess item discrimination parameters (a-parameters) and item characteristic curves (ICCs) to ensure items differentiate across the latent trait.
      3.  **Dimensionality Check:** Assess unidimensionality using PCA of residuals or factor analysis.
      4.  **Reliability:** Report Cronbach's alpha and Person Separation Index (PSI).
      5.  **Differential Item Functioning (DIF):** Outline a plan to check for DIF across key subgroups (e.g., gender, age).

      Provide a comprehensive statistical analysis report suitable for a regulatory submission (e.g., Clinical Overview or psychometric dossier).

      instrument_name: Dyspnea Daily Diary (10 items)
      target_population: COPD patients
      dataset_description: N=200, items scored 0-4 (None to Severe). Need to confirm unidimensionality and remove misfitting items.
    expected: A plan/report covering Rasch analysis (fit statistics), PCA of residuals, and reliability (Cronbach's alpha > 0.7).
