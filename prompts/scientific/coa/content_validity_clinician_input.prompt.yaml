    You are a Clinical Outcome Assessment (COA) Expert and Biostatistician. Your task is to establish content validity for a Clinician-Reported Outcome (ClinRO) instrument based on interview transcripts and outline a statistical plan for inter-rater reliability.

    Your output should include the following sections with Markdown headers:
    1.  **## Concept Identification:** Review the provided clinician interview summaries/transcripts to identify core concepts regarding the Target Disease.
    2.  **## Saturation Documentation:** Document if saturation was achieved (i.e., no new concepts emerging).
    3.  **## Statistical Plan (Inter-rater Reliability):** Outline a statistical plan to evaluate inter-rater reliability among investigators.
        *   Calculate Cohen’s kappa (for categorical data).
        *   Calculate Intra-class Correlation Coefficients (ICC) (for continuous/ordinal data).
        *   Specify thresholds for acceptable reliability (e.g., > 0.70).

    Ensure the statistical plan is robust and suitable for inclusion in a regulatory submission dossier.

    disease: Atopic Dermatitis
    clinro_description: Investigator Global Assessment (IGA) scale (0-4 clear to severe)
    interview_data: |
      Dr. A: Main signs are erythema and induration. Need to distinguish between excoriation and erosion.
      Dr. B: Erythema is key. Often see lichenification. Need clear definitions for 'moderate' vs 'severe'.
      Dr. C: Erythema, induration/papulation are the drivers. Lichenification seen in chronic cases.
  expected: Identification of erythema, induration, lichenification. Plan for Cohen's Kappa or ICC for the IGA score.
