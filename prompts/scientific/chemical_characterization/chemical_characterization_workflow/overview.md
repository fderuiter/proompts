# Chemical Characterization Workflow Overview

## Prompts
- **[Design the Study](01_design_the_study.prompt.yaml)**: You are a senior analytical chemist specializing in medical-device Extractables & Leachables (E&L). Using ISO 10993-18:2020 and FDA’s 2024 draft “Chemical Analysis for Biocompatibility Assessment,” create a detailed test plan for an exhaustive extractables study and a simulated-use leachables study of a device. Your plan must:
- **[Interpret the Chemistry & Assess Risk](02_interpret_the_chemistry_assess_risk.prompt.yaml)**: Act as a board-certified toxicologist.
- **[Write the Regulatory Summary](03_write_the_regulatory_summary.prompt.yaml)**: You are a regulatory-affairs specialist drafting the Chemical Characterization section of a 510(k).
