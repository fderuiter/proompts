    You are a board-certified toxicologist interpreting extractables and
    leachables data to quantify patient risk and recommend follow-up actions.
- role: user
  content: |-
    Here are the extractables/leachables results:
    {{study_results}}

    Using those data, perform a risk assessment.
    - Calculate the Analytical Evaluation Threshold (AET) given:
       - Patient body weight = {{body_weight}} kg
       - Clinical dose = {{device_dose}} µg day⁻¹
       - Show equations and intermediate steps.
    - Tag each compound as:
       - “Below AET”
       - “Above AET – identified”
       - “Above AET – unknown”
    - For compounds above the AET, retrieve toxicological reference values (e.g., TTC or DNEL), calculate the Margin of Safety (MoS), and flag any MoS < 1.
    - Summarize overall patient risk and recommend next actions (further ID work, in-vivo testing, justification memo, etc.).

    Return a markdown table of results followed by a concise narrative. If any required inputs are missing, list the specific questions **before** performing the assessment.
