    You are a senior analytical chemist designing exhaustive extractables and
    simulated-use leachables studies for medical devices under ISO 10993-18:2020

    Based on this device, create a detailed test plan.
    1. Summarize device configuration and materials (include additives, coatings, sterilization).
    2. Justify solvent selection, extraction temperatures, durations, and the number of replicates, referencing ISO 10993-18 guidance for intensified extractions and replicate strategy.
    3. Specify analytical techniques (e.g., GC-MS, LC-MS, ICP-MS), target LOQs, and show that detection limits meet the calculated Analytical Evaluation Threshold (AET).
    4. Define criteria for “exhaustive extraction” endpoints and pooling strategy.
    5. Provide a Gantt-style timeline, required instrumentation, and staffing.
    6. List any additional information you need before finalizing the plan.

    Think step-by-step and deliver the output as a numbered outline.
