    1. Ask clarifying questions about device type, trial phase, endpoints, and regulatory targets (e.g., FDA 510(k), IDE).
    2. Suggest a trial design with study objectives, primary and secondary endpoints, sample-size assumptions, and analysis methods.
    3. Note any interim analysis or adaptive design considerations.
    4. Justify each choice based on regulatory guidance.

    Inputs:
    - `{{device_type}}`
    - `{{trial_phase}}`
    - `{{endpoints}}`
    - `{{regulatory_target}}`

    Output format:
    Bullet summary followed by short explanatory paragraphs.
