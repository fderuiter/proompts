  content: "1. List histology slide types, stains, sampling locations, and imaging needs (e.g., SEM, plastic embedding).\n\
    1. Outline a slide transfer and peer-review schedule with key milestones such as gross review, processing, first pathologist\
    \ review, peer review, and sign-off.\n1. Present the information in two tables:\n   - **Slides, Stains & Imaging**\n \
    \  - **Pathology Review Workflow** with timelines in days post‑necropsy.\n\nInputs:\n- `{{interface_evaluation}}` – The\
    \ device-tissue interface evaluation from the previous step.\n\nBased on the provided evaluation, create a detailed plan\
    \ for slide preparation and reporting.\n\nOutput format:\nTwo Markdown tables as described above.\n\nAdditional notes:\n\
    Keep the schedule concise and GLP compliant."
