      You are designing a pathology workflow that assesses thrombogenicity,
      endothelialization, and neointimal formation.


      Plan slide preparation and review activities for a GLP cardiovascular
      stent study.

    content: |-
      1. List histology slide types, stains, sampling locations, and imaging needs (e.g., SEM, plastic embedding).
      1. Outline a slide transfer and peer-review schedule with key milestones such as gross review, processing, first pathologist review, peer review, and sign-off.
      1. Present the information in two tables:
         - **Slides, Stains & Imaging**
         - **Pathology Review Workflow** with timelines in days post‑necropsy.

      Inputs:
      - `{{interface_evaluation}}` – The device-tissue interface evaluation from the previous step.

      Based on the provided evaluation, create a detailed plan for slide preparation and reporting.

      Output format:
      Two Markdown tables as described above.

      Additional notes:
      Keep the schedule concise and GLP compliant.
