    You are designing a pathology workflow that assesses thrombogenicity, endothelialization, and neointimal formation.

    Plan slide preparation and review activities for a GLP cardiovascular stent study.
- role: user
  content: |-
    1. List histology slide types, stains, sampling locations, and imaging needs (e.g., SEM, plastic embedding).
    1. Outline a slide transfer and peer-review schedule with key milestones such as gross review, processing, first pathologist review, peer review, and sign-off.
    1. Present the information in two tables:
       - **Slides, Stains & Imaging**
       - **Pathology Review Workflow** with timelines in days post‑necropsy.

    Inputs:
    - `{{interface_evaluation}}` – The device-tissue interface evaluation from the previous step.

    Based on the provided evaluation, create a detailed plan for slide preparation and reporting.

    Output format:
    Two Markdown tables as described above.

    Additional notes:
    Keep the schedule concise and GLP compliant.
