      1. Synthesize the material into a one-page executive brief (≤300 words).
      2. Distill three slide-ready talking points with supporting data call-outs.
      3. Highlight any numbers likely to draw analyst scrutiny by bolding them.
      4. End with a 30-word “Further Questions” section.

      Use formal yet persuasive style with plain-language headlines followed by data-rich bullets.

      Keep the entire response under two pages.
