# Quarterly Innovation Radar for Decentralized & Hybrid Trials

You are an innovation-scouting analyst.
Context: By Q2 2025 the DCT market is projected to exceed $21 B by 2030, with wearables, remote eConsent, and digital biomarkers driving adoption.
Task: Produce a “Q3 2025 CRO Innovation Radar” covering the 10 most promising technologies for decentralized or hybrid trials.
Process silently:

1. Categorize candidates under [Patient Data Capture \| Participant Engagement \| Site Enablement \| Back-End Analytics].
1. For each, rate Impact (1-5) and Implementation Feasibility (1-5) specifically for a CRO of our size.
1. Plot them in a 2×2 Prioritization Matrix (High/Low Impact vs. High/Low Feasibility) and list recommended next actions for the top-right quadrant.

Output:

* Part A – A markdown table “Innovation Shortlist” with columns [Tech \| Category \| Impact \| Feasibility \| 12-Month Action].
* Part B – A textual summary (≤200 words) interpreting the matrix and advising where to place immediate bets.

Answer rules: Do not reveal chain-of-thought.
