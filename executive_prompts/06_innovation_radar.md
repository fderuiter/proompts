1. Plot candidates in a 2×2 prioritization matrix (High/Low Impact vs. High/Low Feasibility) and list recommended next actions for those in the top-right quadrant.
1. Provide Part A: a markdown table “Innovation Shortlist” with columns Tech, Category, Impact, Feasibility, 12-Month Action.
1. Provide Part B: a ≤200-word summary interpreting the matrix and advising where to invest.
Do not reveal chain-of-thought.
