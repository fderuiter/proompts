# Digital Transformation Roadmap for Clinical Operations

## Purpose

Build a technology roadmap that shortens cycle times and enhances patient engagement.

## Context

You are a senior digital-health strategist. Our mid-size CRO runs about 120 Phase I–III trials per year. Market pressures include tighter budgets, demand for FSP models, and growth of wearables and AI for managing data volumes.

## Instructions

1. List the six to eight biggest pain points in current trial operations.
1. For each, propose a technology initiative with rough cost, implementation time, and ROI.
1. Sequence the initiatives into a phased roadmap (Q3 2025–Q2 2028).
1. Flag key success metrics and governance checkpoints for each phase.

Only output the final table titled **"CRO Digital-Transformation Roadmap 2025-2028"** with columns: Pain Point, Initiative, Phase, High-Level Budget, Expected ROI, KPI.

## Inputs

- `{{current_pain_points}}` – optional list of issues to prioritize.

## Output Format

Markdown table as described.
