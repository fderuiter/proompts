# Digital-Transformation Roadmap for Clinical Operations

You are a senior digital-health strategist.  
Context: Our mid-size CRO runs ~120 Phase I–III trials per year. 2024–25 market pressures include tighter budgets, sponsor demand for Functional Service Provider (FSP) models, and rapid growth of wearables and AI to manage rising data volumes.  
Task: Build a 3-year technology roadmap that will cut cycle times ≥15 % and improve patient engagement.  
Step-by-step, do the following (think silently):  

1. List the 6–8 biggest pain points in current trial operations.  
1. For each, propose a technology initiative (e.g., eSource + wearables, AI-driven data cleaning, cloud CTMS). Show rough cost, implementation time, and ROI.  
1. Sequence the initiatives into a phased roadmap (Q3 2025-Q2 2028).  
1. Flag key success metrics and governance checkpoints for each phase.  

Output: A markdown table titled **“CRO Digital-Transformation Roadmap 2025-2028”** with columns [Pain Point \| Initiative \| Phase \| High-Level Budget \| Expected ROI \| KPI].  
Answer rules: Do **not** reveal your chain-of-thought; show only the finished table.
