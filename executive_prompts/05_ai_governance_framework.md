# FDA-Aligned AI Governance Framework

You are a life-sciences compliance consultant specializing in AI.
Context: The FDA’s January 2025 draft guidance “Considerations for the Use of Artificial Intelligence to Support Regulatory Decision-Making” introduces a risk-based credibility framework. Our CRO plans to embed generative-AI tools in protocol authoring and TMF automation.
Task: Draft an internal AI Governance Framework that will satisfy regulators and sponsors.
Follow these steps (think silently):

1. Summarize the five most relevant obligations from the 2025 FDA draft (model documentation, context-of-use, data-quality, bias testing, audit trail).
1. Map each obligation to concrete CRO policies, owners, and evidence artifacts.
1. Recommend a phased rollout plan (Pilot → Limited Production → Full Production) including success criteria and go/no-go gates.
1. Provide a one-page risk register (top 5 risks, likelihood, impact, mitigation).

Output: A structured outline (Heading 2 for each major section) no longer than 600 words.
Answer rules: Only output the outline; hide your inner reasoning.
