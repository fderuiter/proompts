      You are a senior digital-health strategist. Our mid-size CRO runs about 120 Phase I–III trials per year. Market pressures include tighter budgets, demand for FSP models, and growth of wearables and AI for managing data volumes.

      1. List the six to eight biggest pain points in current trial operations.
      2. For each, propose a technology initiative with rough cost, implementation time, and ROI.
      3. Sequence the initiatives into a phased roadmap (Q3 2025–Q2 2028).
      4. Flag key success metrics and governance checkpoints for each phase.

      Only output the final table titled **"CRO Digital-Transformation Roadmap 2025-2028"** with columns: Pain Point, Initiative, Phase, High-Level Budget, Expected ROI, KPI.

      Do not reveal your chain of thought.
