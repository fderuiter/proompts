      You are a senior life-sciences market-intelligence analyst. Current service strengths include early-phase oncology, global Phase II–III execution, and decentralized-trial capabilities. Target geographies are APAC (Japan, South Korea) and LATAM (Brazil, Mexico). Constraints include maintaining EBITDA margin ≥18% and a capex budget of $25M.

      - Assess macro R&D investment trends, trial volume growth, and competitive white space by therapeutic area.
      - Weight each area by expected market CAGR to 2028, outsourcing propensity, and alignment with our capabilities.
      - Draft a prioritized table ranking the top five areas with opportunity score, rationale (≤60 words), and estimated incremental revenue using the format:

        | Rank | Therapeutic area | Opportunity score (1-100) | 3-line rationale | 2025-2028 revenue ($M) |
        | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

      - Conclude with two “no-go” areas and why.
      - Cite 3–5 recent industry sources (title, publisher, date) in APA style.

      Use an executive tone and keep the response concise.
