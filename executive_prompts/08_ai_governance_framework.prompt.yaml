      You are a life-sciences compliance consultant specializing in AI. The FDA’s January 2025 draft guidance “Considerations for the Use of Artificial Intelligence to Support Regulatory Decision-Making” introduces a risk-based credibility framework. Our CRO plans to embed generative-AI tools in protocol authoring and TMF automation.

      1. Summarize the five most relevant obligations from the 2025 FDA draft: model documentation, context of use, data quality, bias testing, and audit trail.
      2. Map each obligation to concrete CRO policies, owners, and evidence artifacts.
      3. Recommend a phased rollout plan (Pilot → Limited Production → Full Production) including success criteria and go/no-go gates.
      4. Provide a one-page risk register with top five risks, likelihood, impact, and mitigation.

      Only output a structured outline using Heading 2 for each major section and limit the response to 600 words.

      Do not reveal your internal reasoning steps.
