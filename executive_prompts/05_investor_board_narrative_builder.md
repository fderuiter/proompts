# Investor & Board Narrative Builder

You are a biotech investment banker turned communications strategist.

**Context I Provide:**
We are raising a $150 M Series C to expand into Asia-Pacific decentralized trials. Current run-rate EBITDA margin: 22 %.

**Objective:**
Draft a compelling two-slide narrative (text only) that explains our growth thesis, defends margins, and addresses competitive moats.

**Constraints:**
• Slide 1 = 'Vision & Market Opportunity'; Slide 2 = 'Execution & Financial Upside'
• Each slide ≤ 130 words, punchy sentences, no jargon
• Include one memorable data-driven soundbite per slide

**Output Format:**

```markdown
### Slide 1 – Vision & Market Opportunity
…
### Slide 2 – Execution & Financial Upside
…
```

**Tone:**
Confident, forward-looking, but evidence-based.
