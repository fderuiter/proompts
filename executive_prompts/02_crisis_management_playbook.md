# Crisis-Management Playbook Generator

**“Act as my Chief Risk Officer with a background in Fortune 100 crisis response.

**Scenario:**
Last night we discovered a critical vulnerability in our flagship SaaS platform that could expose customer data.

**Deliverable:**
Create a concise, 4-page Crisis-Management Playbook covering:

 1. Decision-making tree (who approves what, within what timeframe).
 1. Immediate comms templates (internal, media, regulator).
 1. Technical containment steps (high-level; engineers will fill details).
 1. After-action review criteria and timeline.

**Constraints:**
• Follow ISO 22361 terminology.
• Tone: calm, authoritative.
• Use bullet lists and tables where clarity improves speed of reading.

**Reflection step:**
After each main section, add one question to confirm assumptions before finalization.”**
