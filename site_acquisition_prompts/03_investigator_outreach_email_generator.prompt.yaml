      1. Use the provided variables to open with a site-specific hook referencing recent work.
      1. Summarize the study value proposition and why the investigator's patient mix aligns.
      1. Briefly explain the CRO support provided, such as rapid start-up and dedicated CTAs.
      1. Close with a clear CTA linking to a 15‑minute introductory call.

      Inputs:
      - `{{investigator_name}}`
      - `{{site_name}}`
      - `{{city_country}}`
      - `{{recent_relevant_trials}}`
      - `{{unique_site_strength}}`
      - `{{study_synopsis}}`
      - `{{sponsor_name}}`

      Output format:
      JSON object with `subject_line` and `email_body` fields.

      Additional notes:
      Tone should be professional and collaborative. Keep the email between 180 and 220 words. If any variable is blank, ask for it rather than guessing.
