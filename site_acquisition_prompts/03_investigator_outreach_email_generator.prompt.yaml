        Inputs:
        - `{{investigator_name}}` – principal investigator's full name
        - `{{site_name}}` – institution or site name
        - `{{city_country}}` – site location
        - `{{recent_relevant_trials}}` – notable recent trials at the site
        - `{{unique_site_strength}}` – distinctive capability or resource
        - `{{study_synopsis}}` – brief summary of the study
        - `{{sponsor_name}}` – sponsoring company

      Output format:
      JSON object with `subject_line` and `email_body` fields.

      Tone should be professional and collaborative. Keep the email between 180 and 220 words. If any variable is blank, ask for it rather than guessing.
