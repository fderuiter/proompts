   - Prior trials in this indication (past 5 yrs)
   - Average monthly recruitment rate (last trial)
   - Key capacity metric (e.g., open beds)

   - Source links (cite every data source)
4. Cover at least three geographic regions.
5. Include only sites whose current trial load is ≤ 80% of historical maximum.
