# Competitive-Bid Pricing & Margin Optimizer

## Context

Act as my strategic pricing manager. We are bidding on a multi-year oncology study against two top-10 CROs.

## Task

1. Using the cost drivers below, craft three pricing options (Time & Materials, Fixed Fee with Change-Order triggers, and Risk-Share Milestones).
1. For each option, calculate gross margin, probability-weighted downside, and upside.
1. Recommend the option that keeps EBITDA ≥ 18% while remaining price-competitive (assume competitors’ quotes are 5% below industry median).

## Data Inputs

• Regulatory/monitoring premiums = +12% (oncology)

## Response Rules
