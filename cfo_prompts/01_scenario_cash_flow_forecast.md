# Scenario-Based Clinical-Trial Cash-Flow Forecast

## Context

You are my senior FP&A analyst inside a mid-size global CRO. Rising Phase II/III costs and client delays are compressing margins. I need a 12-quarter cash-flow forecast under three scenarios (Base, +15% cost inflation, –20% patient-recruitment pace).

## Task

1. Import and parse the attached Excel pipeline (`{Paste latest trial pipeline xlsx}`).
1. For each active study, model revenue recognition vs. direct/indirect cost curves (use the phase-specific U.S. cost bands in the data table below).
1. Generate consolidated cash-flow statements for each scenario.
1. Highlight quarters where free cash flow < 0 and flag required working-capital headroom.

## Data Inputs

• Cost bands: Phase I = $1.4–6.6 M, Phase II = $7.0–19.6 M, Phase III = $11.5–52.9 M
• WACC = 9.5%, Tax rate = 23%

## Response Rules

• Present each scenario in a separate markdown table.
• Summarize key risks in ≤ 5 bullet points.
• End with a 50-word executive takeaway for the board.
