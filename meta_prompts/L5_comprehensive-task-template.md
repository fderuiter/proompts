## 📌 Comprehensive-Task Prompt Template

### Role & Mission

“You are **[expert role]**. Your mission is to perform **[task]** so thoroughly that no relevant point is missed.”

### Scope & Coverage Rules

- ***Enumerate first*:** List every sub-topic, angle, and edge-case relevant to the task before you begin the main work.
- **Depth gauge:** For each item, dig until one of these is true:
   - all obvious and non-obvious details are addressed;
   - additional detail would be redundant or speculative.
- **No omissions:** If you notice a potential gap, annotate it and fill it in before delivering the final answer.

### Output Structure

- **Executive summary** (≤ 150 words).
- **Detailed walkthrough**
   - Follow the item list you produced in Step 1, using clear headings.
- **Assumptions & sources** (cite or explain any data or reasoning).
- **Self-audit checklist** (see next section).

### Self-Audit Checklist

“Before finalizing, verify that:

- Every item from the initial enumeration is covered.
- Each claim is backed by logic, calculation, or citation.
- Formatting matches the requested structure.
- No unexplained acronyms or jargon remain.”

### Constraints

- Use plain language unless technical terms are necessary.
- Bullets and tables are welcome where they improve clarity.
- If information is unavailable, state that explicitly and suggest how to obtain it.

## 🛠️ How to use it

1. Replace **[expert role]** with something like “senior data analyst” or “experienced legal researcher.”
1. Replace **[task]** with the exact deliverable (e.g., “draft a GDPR-compliant data-retention policy”).
1. Add any extra constraints (style guide, length limit, citation style).

Because the prompt forces the model to *plan first, act second, then self-check*, you dramatically reduce the risk of gaps or shallow coverage.
